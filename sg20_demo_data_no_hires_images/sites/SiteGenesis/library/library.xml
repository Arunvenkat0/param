            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips for wearing high heels with more comfort:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Make  sure that you get high heels that fit.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Wear thin socks or  stockings with your high heels.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Choose high heels that aren't too high.  There are heels and then there are HIGH heels. Skip the ones that are  too tall for you and you'll avoid a lot of the pain that comes from  wearing these shoes. The test that you're supposed to follow is to stand  up in the high heels with your legs straight. Then go up on your tip  toes as high as you can. There should be about an inch of space between  the heel and the floor. If there's not then the heels are too high and  you're going to hurt.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Choose  heels that aren't too narrow. Yes, stilettos are sexy, but they are  also the most painful heels to wear. &lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Break  them in at home. You shouldn't buy a new pair of high heels and then  wear them out for a night of dancing or a day at the office. &lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Stand up straight and  walk in a straight line. The worse your posture and walking habits are,  the worse pain you're going to experience when wearing high heels. &lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Wear foot pads or insoles inside of the high heels. There  are even some that are specifically designed to be used with high heels  to reduce blistering and pain.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Spend some money.  More often than not, expensive high heels are made of a higher quality and  will provide you with more comfort.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Buy lots of shoes!  Change out your shoes  often. Go between heels, flats and sneakers. Choose heels of varying  sizes.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Take care of your feet. Foot soaks, foot massages  and general foot care will help to keep your feet healthy and less prone to pain when wearing high heels.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;</custom-attribute>

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">You can get a cheaper suit and have it tailored for a better fit and look great. You can get away with a shirt that’s slightly unfitted if it’s under your jacket. You can wear cheaper neckties and pocket squares and still look put together. But you can’t wear cheap shoes and have it not look completely noticeable. Rubber soles are obvious on an “oxford” and look cheap and wear terribly. Bad leather not only hurts to wear, but wears badly. And you don’t really know the difference between a quality shoe sole and a bad shoe sole until you’ve broken in a pair of decent shoes that conforms to your feet.&#13;
&#13;
I think a lot of people hate to wear their dress shoes because they claim it make their feet hurt. I think they’re just buying bad shoes to begin with, because if you have a good pair of dress shoes, you’ll want to wear them all the time. It’s like your baseball mitt for your feet — fits perfectly and gets better with age.</custom-attribute>

&lt;h2&gt;It all started with a series of observations:&lt;/h2&gt;		&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;eCommerce merchandising and marketing innovation is what generates the revenue, yet most operations are spending 80% of their budgets simply maintaining current infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;The pace of ecommerce accelerates daily, yet most operations are scrambling to stand still.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Merchandisers and marketers are supremely frustrated, spending more time chasing outsourced providers and internal IT organizations, than actually merchandising and marketing their own businesses.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;	&#13;
&lt;h2&gt;There had to be a better way.&lt;/h2&gt;			&#13;
&lt;p&gt;So in 2004, we set out to find it. The vision&amp;mdash;then and now&amp;mdash;was clear: bring to market an enterprise-class ecommerce solution that would put more power and innovation in the hands of merchandisers and at the same time would remove the technical costs, risks and complexities of running an ecommerce operation. We took what we knew of great ecommerce merchandising (our founders have been in ecommerce since 1994) and applied to it the then-emerging advancements in Software-as-a-Service architectures and dynamic grid computing. Then we worked hard. We stayed up late. We drank lots of coffee. And ultimately, in late 2005, we delivered the market&amp;rsquo;s first on-demand enterprise ecommerce platform.&lt;/p&gt;				&#13;
&lt;h2&gt;Our customers could not be happier with the results.&lt;/h2&gt;		&#13;
&lt;p&gt;With Demandware ecommerce, they're spending more time leading with merchandising and marketing. They're in complete control over their site, making changes and launching new storefronts whenever they like. They're spending more time developing their own proprietary innovations (versus building commodity functionality). They receive new software upgrades from Demandware continuously. And they never-ever-worry about site uptime, availability and security.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;In short, they're free. Free to merchandise. Free to grow. Free to innovate. Free to change. Isn't that how ecommerce is supposed to be?&lt;/p&gt;</custom-attribute>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. HOW I CAN OBTAIN LOANS ON THIS ACCOUNT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
a. Standard and Promotional Purchases.

c. Refinance of Closed-end Loan. If I have any unpaid Closed-end Loans from you at the time I open this Account, I request that you refinance the Closed-end Loans by making a loan from this Account.

I authorize you to charge this Account for the Cost of any purchase I, or anyone to whom I have given permission to use this Account, make from a Merchant using Bill Me Later.

k.	To use Bill Me Later only for personal, family or household purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. SECURITY INTEREST.&lt;/strong&gt; You will not take any security interest to secure this Account.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. FINANCE CHARGE.&lt;/strong&gt; Except during the Grace Period and during the term of an Interest-free Installment Purchase prior to the End Date, I agree to pay a Finance Charge on the outstanding balance of each part of this Account at all times that this Account is in effect, including any period after Termination in which there remains an outstanding balance. The Finance Charge will be calculated for each part of the Account separately, as of the last day in the Billing Cycle (the &amp;quot;Statement Date&amp;quot;), in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
a. Parts of the Account. For the purposes of the Finance Charge, each part of the Account will be calculated separately. Parts may be called &amp;quot;Transaction Types&amp;quot; on the billing statements.&#13;
&lt;p&gt;(i) Standard Purchases. All Standard Purchases and other balances that are moved to the Standard Purchases part of the Account will be a single part.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
(ii) Promotional Purchases. Promotional Purchases while subject to different Promotional rates, terms and Deferred Payment options will be different parts.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Deferred Payment Option. From time to time, you may offer Promotional Purchases with a Deferred Payment option. If I pay the balance on the Deferred Payment part (which is called the &amp;quot;Current Balance&amp;quot;) in full by the Expiration Date, you will not charge any Finance Charge for that part. You will calculate the Finance Charge for each Billing Cycle prior to the Expiration Date and disclose it on the Billing Statement as the Accrued Deferred Finance Charge. If I do not pay the balance on a Deferred Payment part of the Account before the Expiration Date, you may charge my Account, in the Billing Cycle in which the Expiration Date occurs, Finance Charges on the Promotional Purchase from the date of the purchase (the &amp;quot;transaction date&amp;quot;).&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;End of Promotional Terms. If a part is subject to a special promotional rate, term, or Deferred Payment option which ends as of a certain date, I authorize you to move, on or after that date, the balance remaining in that part to the Standard Purchases part of the Account, and it will be subject to the repayment and Finance Charge terms for Standard Purchases.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;(iii) Installment Purchases. Each Installment Purchase will be a part. If there is a balance owing on an Interest-free Installment Purchase after the End Date, I authorize you to move, on or after the End Date, that balance to the Standard Purchases part of the Account, and it will be subject to the repayment and Finance Charge terms for Standard Purchases.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;b. When the Finance Charge begins. The Finance Charge begins to accrue on the transaction date, except Finance Charge does not accrue during the Grace Period, if applicable to that part, and does not accrue prior to the End Date on an Interest-free Installment Purchase.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;c. Grace Period. You will not assess a Finance Charge on Standard or Promotional Purchases during any Billing Cycle in which my payments and credits on or before the Payment Due Date reduce the outstanding balance for Standard and Promotional Purchases (excluding Standard and Promotional Purchases I made during the Billing Cycle and Promotional Purchases which are subject to a Deferred Payment option) to zero or to a credit balance. No Grace Period will apply to a Promotional Purchase subject to a Deferred Payment option or to a Financed Installment Purchase.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;d. How you will determine the balance on which the Finance Charge is computed. You will compute the Finance Charge for each part on the &amp;quot;Average Daily Balance&amp;quot; (including new purchases) for that part during the Billing  Cycle. To get the Average Daily Balance for each part, you will take the beginning balance for each part each day and add any new loans and adjustments posted that day; then subtract any payments, credits, and unpaid Finance Charges allocated to that part. This gives you the &amp;quot;Daily Balance.&amp;quot; Then, you add up all the Daily Balances for the Billing Cycle for that part and  divide the total by the number of days in the Billing Cycle. The result is  the Average Daily Balance for that part. You will treat any Average Daily  Balance which is a credit balance as zero.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;e. How you compute the Finance Charge. You will compute the Finance  Charge during the Billing Cycle for each part separately. For each part, you  will multiply the Average Daily Balance for the Billing Cycle by the number  of days in the Billing Cycle; then you will multiply the product by the Daily  Periodic Rate in effect for that part during that Billing Cycle. The result  is the Finance Charge for that part. You will then add up the Finance Charge  for all the parts, to get the Finance Charge for the Account.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;f. Minimum Finance Charge. If the Daily Balance of any part (excluding  any balance on an Interest-free Installment Purchase part), on the last day  of a Billing Cycle (the Statement Date), is greater than zero, and if the  Finance Charge for the Billing Cycle is greater than zero but less than $0.40,  you may assess a Finance Charge of $0.40 for the Billing Cycle.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;g. Rate of Finance Charge. You will compute the Finance Charge on the  Standard, Promotional and Financed Installment Purchases parts using the Daily  Periodic Rate disclosed in the enclosed Important Disclosures. This corresponds  to the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE disclosed in the enclosed Important Disclosures.  However, if you have disclosed a special promotional rate at the time you  made the special offer, according to law, you will compute the Finance Charge  on the Promotional Purchases parts using that special promotional rate.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. OTHER CHARGES.&lt;/strong&gt; I agree to pay the following Other Charges, as applicable. I agree that you may allocate any Other Charge to the Standard Purchases part of the Account.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;a. Late Fee.  You will charge me a Late Fee for each month the Minimum Payment is not paid  in full by its Payment Due Date. The amount of the late fee is disclosed in  the Important Disclosures. No Late Fee will be due if the reason the Payment is late is either: (i) attributable to a Late Fee assessed on an earlier payment; or (ii) because, after default, the entire balance on this Account is due.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;b. Return Check Fee. You will charge me a service charge of $20.00 if my payment on this Account  is made with a check, including a draft, order or other instrument that is  returned by a drawee for &amp;quot;not sufficient funds&amp;quot; in the account on  which the check is written. You will not charge the service charge, however,  if you redeposit the check and it is paid.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;c. Fee for providing a copy of billing statement. Unless you are required  by law to provide me with a copy of a billing statement for a Billing Cycle  other than the current Billing Cycle, I agree to pay you a fee of ten dollars  ($10.00) per billing statement if I request a copy.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. MINIMUM PAYMENT DUE.&lt;/strong&gt; The Minimum Payment will be due each Billing Cycle, on or before the Payment Due Date. The amount of the Minimum Payment Due will be the sum of the Monthly Plan Payments due on each Installment Purchase part plus the payment due for the revolving parts plus any amounts past due from previous Billing Cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;a. Revolving  Parts. The payment due for the revolving parts will be the greater of  (A) $10.00; or (B) 3% of the sum of the balances on the revolving parts (excluding  any balance subject to a Deferred Payment option), on the last day of the  Billing Cycle. The payment will be rounded down to the next whole dollar. In no event, however, will the payment due be greater than the sum of the  total outstanding balances on those parts.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;b. Installment Parts. The Monthly Plan Payment due for each Installment  Purchase which has not reached its End Date and on which a balance is outstanding  will be the installment payment amount I agree to when I make an Installment  Purchase. The Monthly Plan Payments for an Installment Purchase will be calculated  so that they are substantially equal over the term of the Installment Purchase.  In no event, however, will the Monthly Plan Payment due for any Installment  Purchase be greater than the outstanding balance due on that part of the Account.  The Monthly Plan Payment due on the End Date may be more or less than the  others, because it will be adjusted as necessary to pay the actual balance  and accrued Finance Charge owing on the End Date.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. PREPAYMENT.&lt;/strong&gt; If I pay an amount greater than the Minimum Payment Due in any Billing Cycle, this will not affect the way you calculate the amount of the next Minimum Payment, and I will nevertheless make the Minimum Payment the next Billing Cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;I MAY MAKE PAYMENTS IN ANY AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM PAYMENT AND MAY PAY THE ENTIRE BALANCE OR ANY PART OF IT AT ANY TIME PROVIDED THAT I PAY AT LEAST THE MINIMUM PAYMENT DUE IN EACH BILLING CYCLE WHEN IT IS DUE.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. PAYMENT APPLICATION.&lt;/strong&gt; You will use each payment that I make, when I am not in default, first to pay billed Monthly Plan Payments on the Installment Purchases (in any order you choose), then billed Finance Charge, then billed other charges, then the principal balance of the revolving parts (in any order you choose), and then any other amounts due.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. BILLING STATEMENTS.&lt;/strong&gt; You will send me a billing statement for each Billing Cycle in which:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;a. You  impose a Finance Charge to this Account; or b. The New Balance is more than $1.00 (whether a credit or debit balance). I agree to notify you in writing of any errors in the billing statement within 60 days from the date it is mailed. I agree to examine the billing statement and to notify you in writing, immediately, of any purchases which were not made or authorized by me. You need not mail a billing statement to me if you deem this Account uncollectible or if delinquency collection proceedings have been started.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. DEFAULT.&lt;/strong&gt; I will be in default if any of the following happen:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;a. If  I fail to pay any Minimum Payment Due on or before the Payment Due Date.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;b. If I fail to keep any promise or perform any duty in this Agreement,  or in any other loan or agreement with you.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;If default occurs, you will have no duty to make loans or advances from this Account and this Account will be Terminated. You may refuse to make any new loans and may cancel any approved loans from the Account for any Purchase or transaction that has not yet appeared on a billing statement sent to me. This may happen without any prior notice to me. If you choose, at your sole option, to make new loans from this Account after default, I agree that you may charge those loans to this Account. In addition, if a default occurs, all amounts which I owe under this Agreement shall be due and payable immediately, at your option (subject to any applicable law to the contrary); you may apply any payments I make after default to satisfy the amounts I owe on any part of the Account, in any order you choose. The other provisions of this Agreement will continue to apply to this Account. If you get a judgment after default and/or if I am a debtor in an action filed by or against me under the Bankruptcy Code, unless prohibited by applicable law, the rates of Finance Charge applicable to this Account will continue to apply to the balances on this Account. A default under this Agreement is a default under every other account or loan which I have with you.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16. TERMINATION OF THE ACCOUNT.&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to Termination by default, you may Terminate this Agreement at any time and for any reason subject to the requirements of applicable law. I can terminate my Account by sending written notice to the address on the billing statement. After Termination, I will not be able to make new purchases on this Account. Termination under this paragraph will not affect any purchase which complies with this Agreement and which was made before the date of the Termination notice. If you choose, at your sole option, to allow purchases after you have Terminated this Account (whether or not I have given you notice Terminating this Account), I agree that you may charge those purchases to this Account. After Termination under this paragraph, balances will continue to accrue Finance Charges until paid in full and I agree to pay the balance on this Account, the Finance Charges and all other amounts due in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All other provisions of this Agreement will continue to apply.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17. YOUR LIABILITY.&lt;/strong&gt; You have no responsibility for the failure of any Merchant to accept payment using the Bill Me Later Payment System. Your liability, if liability is provided under applicable law, for a wrongful failure to make a loan on this Account is limited to my actual damages. Failure to make a loan for any reason as provided under the terms of this Agreement will not be wrongful.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18. AMENDMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.&lt;/strong&gt; You may amend this Agreement from time to time, in any respect by giving me written notice where required by law. An amendment may change something in this Agreement (for example, the rate of Finance Charge on any or all the parts), add something new or take something out. Such amendments will apply to outstanding balances and new loans, except as otherwise indicated in the written notice or provided by applicable law. This Agreement, except when amended in accordance with this Agreement, is the final expression of the Agreement between us and may not be contradicted by evidence of any alleged oral agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19. REMEDIES CUMULATIVE.&lt;/strong&gt; Your remedies under this Agreement shall be cumulative and not alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20. DELAY IN ENFORCEMENT.&lt;/strong&gt; You can delay enforcing any of your rights under this Agreement without losing them. Any waiver by you of any provision of this Agreement will not be a waiver of the same or any other provision on any other occasion.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;21. ASSIGNMENT.&lt;/strong&gt; I may not assign or otherwise transfer my rights and privileges under this Agreement, or delegate my obligations to repay amounts I owe to you. Any attempt to assign or delegate will be void and of no effect. You may assign any and all of your rights under this Agreement at any time without my consent. Any person, company or bank to whom you assign this Agreement shall be entitled to all of your rights under this Agreement. None of my rights or obligations shall be affected by such assignment.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;22. REPLACEMENT OF PRIOR AGREEMENTS.&lt;/strong&gt; This Agreement replaces all earlier Agreements and governs all balances on this Account, including balances carried over to this Account from any prior Account, just as if it had been in effect before the first advance from this Account. If this Agreement replaces an earlier Agreement I had with a different Lender, all balances from the earlier Bill Me Later Account will become balances on this Account. The effective date of the new Account may be delayed, at your option, up to sixty (60) days; during those sixty (60) days, all balances will be balances on the earlier Account. No rates, charges, fees or required minimum payments stated in the earlier Agreement will change due to a change in the Lender, unless Lender amends this Agreement as provided in this Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;23. COMMUNICATIONS CONCERNING DISPUTED DEBTS.&lt;/strong&gt; ALL COMMUNICATIONS BY ME TO YOU CONCERNING DISPUTED DEBTS, INCLUDING AN INSTRUMENT TENDERED AS FULL SATISFACTION OF THE ACCOUNT, WILL BE SENT TO: Bill Me Later, P.O. Box 5018, Timonium, MD 21094.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24. CREDIT INVESTIGATION AND REPORTING.&lt;/strong&gt; I authorize you to make or have made any credit, employment and investigative inquiries you deem appropriate related to this Account and the collection of amounts owed on this Account. I agree that you have the right to obtain a credit report in connection with your review of my application and periodically, during the term of this Account, as you deem reasonably necessary to maintain and collect this Account. I authorize you to answer any questions about your experience with me related to this Account and to report that experience to credit reporting agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;25. NOTICES AND CUSTOMER SERVICE.&lt;/strong&gt; I agree that any notice or correspondence that you are required by this Agreement or by law to send to me may be sent by regular U.S. mail to the address that I have provided or by e-mail to the e-mail address that I have provided, unless otherwise required by law. I will send all notices, correspondence, inquiries and questions concerning my Account to you at Bill Me Later, P.O. Box 22140, Tulsa, OK 74121-2140. I may also call you at your customer service telephone number 1-866-528-3733. You may monitor, tape or electronically record my telephone calls to your customer service department for any reasonable business purpose. I agree that your customer service department may place telephone calls to me using an automatic dialing and announcing device for any reasonable business purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;26. GOVERNING LAW AND CONSTRUCTION.&lt;/strong&gt; This Agreement has been accepted by you in Delaware, U.S.A., and all loans will be extended by you in Delaware, U.S.A. Regardless of the state of my residence or the place where the Merchant is located, I agree that the provisions of this Agreement relating to interest, charges and fees shall be governed by federal law and construed in accordance with federal law and, as made applicable by federal law, Delaware law. Other terms and provisions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of Delaware, U.S.A., without regard to principals of conflicts of law, except to the extent preempted, superseded, or supplemented by federal law.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27. SEVERABILITY.&lt;/strong&gt; If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such determination shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;28. BORROWER'S BILLING RIGHTS - KEEP THIS NOTICE FOR FUTURE USE.&lt;/strong&gt; This notice is required by federal law. In this notice, &amp;quot;you&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;your&amp;quot; mean the Borrower. &amp;quot;We&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;our&amp;quot; refer to the Lender.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
This notice contains important information about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Notify Us In Case of Errors or Questions About Your Bill.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;If you think your bill is wrong, or if you need more information about a transaction on your bill, write us on a separate sheet at Bill Me Later, P.O. Box 5018, Timonium, MD 21094. Write us as soon as possible. We must hear from you no later than 60 days after we send you the first bill on which the error or problem appeared. You can telephone us, but doing so will not preserve your rights. In your letter, give us the following information:&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Your name and account number.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;The dollar amount of the suspected error.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Describe the error and explain, if you can, why you believe there is an error. If you need more information, describe the item you are not sure about.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Your Rights and Our  Responsibilities After We Receive Your Written Notice.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
We must acknowledge your letter within 30 days, unless we have corrected the error by then.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Within 90 days we must either correct the error or explain why we believe the bill was correct.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
After we receive your letter, we cannot try to collect any amount you question, or report you as delinquent. We can continue to bill you for the amount you question, including Finance Charges. You do not have to pay any questioned amount while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question. If we find that we made a mistake on your bill, you will not have to pay any Finance Charges related to the questioned amount. If we did not make a mistake, you may have to pay Finance Charges, and you will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, we will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date that it is due.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
If you fail to pay the amount that we think you owe, we may report you as delinquent. However, if our explanation does not satisfy you and you write to us within ten (10) days telling us that you still refuse to pay, we must tell anyone we report you to that you have a question about your bill, and we must tell you the name of anyone we reported you to. We must tell anyone we report you to that the matter has been settled between us when it finally. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;I want to take photos that I can e-mail to friends and family, post on the Web, or print in sizes smaller than 8x10 inches. I'd like a digital camera that is easy enough for the whole family to use and small enough to take anywhere.

&lt;hr /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Before we dive into the types of navigation systems and buying advice, it's always good to get a little background on the technology and have a basic understanding of how it works. Originally developed in 1973 by the U.S. Department of Defense for military purposes, the NAVSTAR GPS network consists of 30 satellites orbiting the earth every 12 hours, and five ground stations that monitor the satellites' position in space and operational status. To determine your location and other data accurately, such as current and average speed, directional heading, and elevation, GPS devices use a receiver to acquire signals from at least four of these satellites. This is known as a 3D fix and it's why GPS antennas require an unobstructed view of the sky to work correctly.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Armed with your precise latitude, longitude, and other location data, the GPS receiver can overlay this information onto map files stored on the unit, revealing your current position on the map as well as where you've been. Since the receiver is constantly recalculating your position relative to the satellite's position, the GPS unit can track your location in real time. A typical GPS device contains a 12-channel receiver and an antenna to capture satellite signals, and a CPU to process the data. The quality of the receiver and your geographic location will determine how long it takes the device to acquire a 3D fix. For example, it's harder for the receiver to lock onto and hold a signal if you're traveling through a dense forest or an urban area with tall buildings.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The first time you fire up your GPS, it collects certain satellite information to determine your whereabouts. Known as a cold start, the receiver is essentially blank and needs to know what time it is, where the satellites are in their orbital patterns, and where it is in relation to the satellites. Most systems take around one to two minutes to acquire a 3D fix during a cold start, while some can take a few minutes. Thereafter, it can take as little as 3 to 4 seconds to lock in since the unit already has your coordinates and a general location of the satellites. A good receiver will instantly recover from a complete signal loss when you drive through a tunnel, for instance, while weaker units will require more time to reacquire a 3D fix. In some cases, you'll have to stop the car to give the receiver a chance to lock on to the requisite signals.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How well a GPS unit will work in your car depends on the location of the antenna. If your vehicle has a factory installed in-dash unit, chances are the antenna is integrated into the dashboard in a place where it has an unobstructed view of the sky, which is ideal. Many portable models are designed to be positioned directly on the windshield via a suction cup mounting device, giving the antenna a wide sky view. There are also add-on antennas available for GPS units that allow you to keep the receiver close to the front seat for easy viewing without sacrificing signal quality.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</custom-attribute>

&lt;p class="Summary"&gt;MP3 players are definitely not one-size-fits-all. They come in a range of shapes and sizes, use different types of memory, and support different formats. Based on these and other features, certain players are better suited to certain uses--you should choose the player (or players) that meets your needs.

&lt;div class="subArticle"&gt;&#13;
&lt;p class="Summary"&gt;As we see it, here are some top uses for MP3 players, as well as some questions that you should consider in order to figure out if one or more of these usage models will suit you. Some people align with more than one use, and they should possibly consider buying more than one MP3 player to address various needs. For instance, you might want an ultracompact flash player for jogging or skiing and a high-capacity hard-drive-based device for traveling.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;p class="Summary"&gt;Of course, plenty of people just want an MP3 player for general, day-to-day use. If you're simply after a device that plays good-sounding music and is easy to use, any of the top products listed are perfectly suited for this. However, if you're looking for a device for a particular use, read on.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&lt;p&gt;You listen to your stereo at home and to your computer at work, but filling your commute with tunes requires a portable player. If you commute by car, look for a hard-drive-based model; size doesn't matter much in this situation, so you may as well maximize your value. Connecting your MP3 player to your car audio system can be done with an FM transmitter, cassette adapter, Bluetooth transmitter (if your stereo is Bluetooth compatible), or by purchasing an aftermarket car stereo with an iPod dock or line-input connection. If you commute via subway or bus, look for a compact flash-based player and, to seal out as much of the din as possible, a pair of &lt;a href="http://cnet.com/best-headphones/"&gt;noise-canceling or sound-isolating&lt;/a&gt; headphones.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&lt;div class="subArticleContent"&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;If you spend all your free time in the gym, you need an MP3 player that can keep pace. It should be compact and easy to operate with one hand. Rather than looking for one with massive storage, choose a flash-based model (1GB of storage should be plenty, but more can't hurt) that can also withstand tough workouts better than hard-drive-based players. You may also want an armband, an option on many ultracompact models, and a set of headphones that will stay in place rather than the cheap earbuds typically included. Also, look for sweat-resistant models and other fitness-friendly extras, such as a calorie counter or pedometer. And remember: many gyms offer TVs that you can tune into with an FM radio, so be sure to consider players that include that feature as well.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

&lt;p&gt;If you spend a lot of time on the road, you need an MP3 player that will enhance your journeys with music yet doesn't add undue weight to your carry-on. If you travel with the same laptop that stores your music, a compact flash-based player is the way to go, but if you'd rather leave the laptop at home, try a higher-capacity player that will hold all or most of your music--bonus points for one that has an easily removable and replaceable battery. Accessories worthy of consideration include noise-canceling or sound-isolating headphones for the plane, as well as a portable speaker setup for your hotel room.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

&lt;div class="subArticleContent"&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;MP3 players have quickly become the medium of choice for listening to audiobooks. Compared to CD and cassette players, an average MP3 player is small and has the capacity to hold many hours worth of audio. With download-only audiobook vendors such as Audible.com and iTunes offering a relatively inexpensive alternative to purchasing or renting audiobooks on CD or cassette, there's more incentive than ever for travelers and book lovers to take a listen. If you're looking to purchase an MP3 player that works well with audiobooks, there's a couple things to keep in mind. The first is whether it's compatible with popular audiobook sites Audible.com or iTunes. The second is if the player has bookmarking, a rather critical feature that will keep you from having to fast-forward through extra-long audio files.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

&lt;p&gt;If your appetite for digital music has your computer's hard drives bursting at the seams, you fit the description of the file hoarder. While sound quality and features are important to you, what you need most is an enormous capacity. With portable music devices reaching up to 160GB, it shouldn't be difficult for you to find a hard-drive player with enough storage to suit your needs.&lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

&lt;p&gt;For some reason, MP3 player manufacturers have been loath to embrace tapers and other portable-recording aficionados and rarely include a mike-level input. That said, a number of players on the market can record from line-level sources such as CD players or stereo outputs, so they're great for converting CDs, tapes, and vinyl records to digital formats such as MP3, WAV, or WMA. Those wishing to record live audio can do the same, although they'll need a powered microphone that can output a line-level signal. Or if voice recording is all you need, look for a model with a built-in mic. &lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, the line between MP3 players and portable video players (PVPs) is blurrier than ever, as the majority of devices hitting the market include video playback as a feature. Although the screen on a typical MP3 player is too small for extended video viewing, it can be a nice bonus for certain users. Undeniably, MP3 players with relatively large screens make the best substitute PVPs--make sure you look for those that are at least 2-inches diagonal. No denying it's nice to have that extra distraction in certain situations, such as doctors' waiting rooms and airport terminals. &lt;sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

        <description xml:lang="x-default">After you have your budget squared away, you need to decide how large of a screen you want. Usually, the largest screens cost the most, but regardless, the TV should deliver the right-size picture for where you'll sit relative to the screen. Sitting closer to a smaller TV means you won't have to spend as much on a big screen. But if you sit too close, the picture will look poor. Regular TV-viewing distances. Most viewers feel comfortable sitting away from the set at a distance that's between three and six times the width of the screen. The following chart can give you a rough estimate of the minimum and maximum viewing distances for regular 4:3 televisions.</description>

Since the first HDTVs appeared in 1998, high-definition television has been on the mind of every TV buyer. The big question is whether now is the time to pay a few hundred to a few thousand dollars more and take the plunge on an HDTV set. We can't answer that question for you, but we can provide some basic information that may help you decide.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;HDTV basics: &lt;a href="#analog"&gt;Analog, digital, and HDTV&lt;/a&gt; |  &lt;a href="#tuners"&gt;HDTV tuners&lt;/a&gt; |  &lt;a href="#resolutions"&gt;HDTV resolutions&lt;/a&gt; |&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;a href="#regular"&gt;Regular TV and DVD on an HDTV&lt;/a&gt; |  &lt;a href="#tomorrow"&gt;Your HDTV tomorrow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="analog"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h3 class="a3"&gt;Analog, digital, and HDTV&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analog:&lt;/b&gt; An analog TV cannot display HDTV programming. It can show only standard-definition programs such as those found on regular TV, cable, or satellite channels--including digital cable and DirecTV or Dish Network. 		&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;b&gt;Digital:&lt;/b&gt; The words &amp;quot;digital television&amp;quot; are used as a generic term for SDTV, EDTV, or HDTV.  		&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;b&gt;SDTV:&lt;/b&gt; A standard-definition television is an analog television equipped with a built-in ATSC tuner (see below), which allows it to receive digital TV broadcasts. It will display a picture from these broadcasts, but HDTV shows won't look nearly as detailed as they would on a true HDTV. 		&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;b&gt;EDTV:&lt;/b&gt; This stands for Enhanced-Definition TV, and usually it describes a television that can display HDTV signals but doesn't have enough resolution to really do them justice. Most often it applies to plasma TVs and denotes 852x480 pixels (&lt;a href="http://www.cnet.com/4520-7874_1-5137915-1.html?tag=txt"&gt;more info&lt;/a&gt;). 		&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;b&gt;HDTV:&lt;/b&gt; High-definition televisions, or HDTVs, can display standard TV, progressive-scan DVD, and HDTV signals. They're by far the most common type of digital television.  Nearly every plasma, LCD, and rear-projection TV is an HDTV.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;b&gt;EDTV monitor&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;HDTV monitor:&lt;/b&gt; Describes a television that lacks a built-in tuner of any kind. These sets still work perfectly well with external tuners, including HD-compatible satellite and cable boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;div align="right" class="v1" style="padding-top:5px;padding-bottom:20px;"&gt;&amp;raquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#top"&gt;Back to top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="tuners"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h3 class="a3"&gt;HDTV tuners&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;div class="prodshot v1"&gt;&lt;a href="http://cnet.com/tv-hdtv-tuners-receivers/samsung-dtb-h260f-hdtv/4505-6487_7-32385887.html"&gt;&lt;img width="120" height="90" border="0" alt="Samsung's DTB-H260F" src="images/buyingGuides/hdtv tuner.gif?$staticlink$" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Samsung's DTB-H260F external ATSC tuner&lt;/div&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Over the air:&lt;/b&gt;  By law, as of March 1, 2007, almost all televisions should include a built-in tuner (called HDTV, digital, or ATSC tuners) that can receive high-definition programs over the air by simply connecting an antenna. If your HDTV doesn't have such a tuner, you'll also need to connect an external tuner (or cable or satellite box) to watch high-definition programming. External over-the-air HDTV tuners currently cost at least $150.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a name="fcc" class="b"&gt;FCC tuner mandate:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; You may have heard that all TVs will have to be HDTVs by a certain date. That's not technically correct. The FCC has mandated that as of March 1, 2007, all new TV and video products imported into the U.S. or shipped to retailers that include an analog (&lt;a href="http://cnet.com/4520-6029_7-6159727-1.html"&gt;NTSC&lt;/a&gt;) tuner need to have a digital ATSC tuner as well. There's a loophole though: if the product contains no tuner whatsoever--for TVs, this means it's a &amp;quot;monitor&amp;quot;--then the mandate does not apply. As a result of the mandate, nearly all televisions sold after that date should be ready for the analog switch-off.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analog TV broadcast switch-off:&lt;/b&gt; Congress has passed a bill that requires over-the-air television stations to switch completely over to digital broadcasting after February 17, 2009. After that date, TVs and other gear with NTSC tuners will be unable to receive over-the-air broadcasts. Anyone who watches TV via &amp;quot;rabbit ears&amp;quot; or a rooftop antenna (as opposed to cable or satellite), and whose TV does not have a built-in or separate digital tuner, will stop receiving programs on that TV. Because the switch-off of analog TV broadcasts would deprive many viewers of their only source of television, Congress also created a subsidy program. Run by the government's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), the program will provide $40 coupons, limit of two per household, each of which can be used to pay for one digital converter box. The boxes, which are supposed to sell for $50-$70 each and be available from electronics retailers, can receive digital broadcasts to provide standard-definition programming to an existing analog-tuner TV. These coupons (which cannot be combined or used for other products) should be available from early 2008 through March 31, 2009 but must be used within 90 days of their issuance and only on certain converter products. As 2008 approaches, you can find more information on this program at &lt;a href="http://www.dtvtransition.org"&gt;www.dtvtransition.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;b&gt;Cable and satellite:&lt;/b&gt; The FCC's plans for ATSC tuners have nothing to do with HDTV over cable and satellite. Subscribers to pay TV services can simply get a set-top box that tunes HDTV channels, plug it into their HDTV-ready sets, and watch HDTV.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;div class="prodshot v1"&gt;&lt;img width="120" height="90" border="0" alt="DCR" src="images/buyingGuides/120_DCRlogo.gif?$staticlink$" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Some new HDTVs are  &lt;i&gt;digital cable ready&lt;/i&gt; (DCR), meaning they can tune digital cable channels, including HDTV if the cable provider has HDTV channels, without needing an external cable box. To use a DCR television, you'll need to get a special access card from your cable provider, called a CableCard. Unlike actual digital cable boxes, current DCR TVs can't do video-on-demand at all, and you must pick up a phone if you want to order pay-per-view programs. Using the card with some sets also means you can't access the &lt;a href="http://www.cnet.com/4520-7874_1-5107912-6.html?tag=txt#epg"&gt;electronic program guide (EPG)&lt;/a&gt;, although many new DCR HDTVs include a third-party EPG, such as the TV Guide system, as a substitute.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;div align="right" class="v1" style="padding-top:5px;padding-bottom:20px;"&gt;&amp;raquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#top"&gt;Back to top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="resolutions"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h3 class="a3"&gt;HDTV resolutions&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Resolution,&lt;/i&gt; or picture detail, is the main reason why HDTV programs look so good. The standard-definition programming most of us watch today has at most 480 visible lines of detail, whereas HDTV has as many as 1,080. HDTV looks sharper and clearer than regular TV by a wide margin, especially on big-screen televisions. It actually comes in two different resolutions, called 1080i and 720p. One is not necessarily better than the other; 1080i has more lines and pixels, but 720p is a progressive-scan format that should deliver a smoother image that stays sharper during motion. Another format is also becoming better known: 1080p, which combines the superior resolution of 1080i with the progressive-scan smoothness of 720p. True 1080p content is scarce outside of &lt;a href="http://www.cnet.com/4520-13378_1-6698792-1.html"&gt;Blu-ray, HD DVD&lt;/a&gt; and the latest video games, however, and none of the major networks has announced 1080p broadcasts. Check out our comparison chart to see how HDTV stacks up against standard TV and progressive-scan DVD, and go to &lt;a href="http://www.cnet.com/4520-7874_1-5137915-1.html"&gt;HDTV resolution explained&lt;/a&gt; for more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&lt;h3 class="a3"&gt;Regular TV and DVD on an HDTV&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Regular TV on an HDTV:&lt;/b&gt; Many people bringing home an HDTV for the first time are disappointed by the picture they see. That's usually because they're watching a regular, standard-definition channel instead of an HDTV channel. Regular TV on an HDTV can look pretty bad, especially in comparison to high-definition programming. HDTVs are bigger and sharper than older standard-definition TVs, so they show off more of the flaws and relative softness of SD channels and content. Some HDTVs can improve lower-quality sources a bit more than others can, but in general there isn't much any HDTV can do to make standard-def TV programming look better. 		&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;b&gt;DVD on an HDTV:&lt;/b&gt; HDTVs can make DVD, a very high-quality source, look spectacular, and most people are quite satisfied by the look of DVD on their HDTVs. Many DVD players, and all &lt;a href="http://cnet.com/4520-6463_7-6462511-1.html"&gt;Blu-ray and HD DVD players&lt;/a&gt;, also have built-in &lt;a href="http://cnet.com/4520-6029_7-6281668-1.html"&gt;upconversion&lt;/a&gt; or upscaling processing, which is supposedly designed to convert DVDs to high-definition resolution. In most cases, however, the benefits of this conversion process, if any, will be subtle.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;div align="right" class="v1" style="padding-top:5px;padding-bottom:20px;"&gt;&amp;raquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="#top"&gt;Back to top&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name="tomorrow"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h3 class="a3"&gt;Your HDTV tomorrow&lt;/h3&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;If you buy an HDTV today, you can be fairly certain it won't become obsolete anytime in the next few years. Yes, new technologies come out every year, but nothing on the scale of the shift from standard-def to high-def TV will occur again for a good, long time. Nearly every current HDTV is equipped with a future-ready HDMI input, which assures compliance with tougher copy-protection standards, and as long as your new HDTV has one, you should be good to go.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

        <custom-attributes>
            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It all started with a series of observations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&#13;
				&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt;eCommerce merchandising and marketing innovation is what generates the revenue, yet most operations are spending 80% of their budgets simply maintaining current infrastructure.&#13;
					&lt;li&gt;The pace of ecommerce accelerates daily, yet most operations are scrambling to stand still.&#13;
					&lt;li&gt;Merchandisers and marketers are supremely frustrated, spending more time chasing outsourced providers and internal IT organizations, than actually merchandising and marketing their own businesses.&#13;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
				&#13;
				&lt;h5 class="internal"&gt;There had to be a better way.&lt;/h5&gt;&#13;
				&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;So in 2004, we set out to find it. The vision&amp;mdash;then and now&amp;mdash;was clear: bring to market an enterprise-class ecommerce solution that would put more power and innovation in the hands of merchandisers and at the same time would remove the technical costs, risks and complexities of running an ecommerce operation. We took what we knew of great ecommerce merchandising (our founders have been in ecommerce since 1994) and applied to it the then-emerging advancements in Software-as-a-Service architectures and dynamic grid computing. Then we worked hard. We stayed up late. We drank lots of coffee. And ultimately, in late 2005, we delivered the market&amp;rsquo;s first on-demand enterprise ecommerce platform.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&#13;
				&lt;h5 class="internal"&gt;Our customers could not be happier with the results.&lt;/h5&gt;&#13;
				&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;With Demandware ecommerce, they're spending more time leading with merchandising and marketing. They're in complete control over their site, making changes and launching new storefronts whenever they like. They're spending more time developing their own proprietary innovations (versus building commodity functionality). They receive new software upgrades from Demandware continuously. And they never-ever-worry about site uptime, availability and security.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;In short, they're free. Free to merchandise. Free to grow. Free to innovate. Free to change. Isn't that how ecommerce is supposed to be?&lt;/p&gt;</custom-attribute>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hint:&lt;/strong&gt; For the most accurate results, measure yourself in your undergarments.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neck:&lt;/strong&gt; Measure around the base of your neck, inserting your forefinger between the tape and your neck to allow ease in fit.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chest:&lt;/strong&gt; Measure around the fullest part of your chest, keeping tape firmly under your armpits and around your shoulder blades.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waist:&lt;/strong&gt; Measure around your waist, slightly below your natural waist, where you normally wear your pants. Insert your forefinger between the tape and your body to allow ease in fit.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleeve Length:&lt;/strong&gt; Bend your arm slightly. Measure from center back neck, across your shoulder, down to your elbow, down to your wrist.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hip:&lt;/strong&gt; Measure around the fullest part of your hips, inserting your forefinger between the tape and your hip to allow ease in fit.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inseam:&lt;/strong&gt; Measure a similar pant that fits you well. Measure along the inseam, from the crotch seam to the bottom of the hem.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;/div&gt;&#13;
&lt;div class="nofit"&gt;&#13;
&lt;h2&gt;Doesn't Fit?&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;If it doesn't fit, return it within 28 days, as long as it's unworn, unwashed and unaltered.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;a href="$url('Page-Show', 'cid', 'returns')$"&gt;See Returns Policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h2&gt;Between Sizes?&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;If your measurements are in between those listed in the size chart, pick the next larger size.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hint:&lt;/strong&gt; For the most accurate results, measure yourself in your undergarments.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neck:&lt;/strong&gt; Measure around the base of your neck, inserting your forefinger between the tape and your neck to allow ease in fit.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chest:&lt;/strong&gt; Measure around the fullest part of your chest, keeping tape firmly under your armpits and around your shoulder blades.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waist:&lt;/strong&gt; Measure around your waist, slightly below your natural waist, where you normally wear your pants. Insert your forefinger between the tape and your body to allow ease in fit.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleeve Length:&lt;/strong&gt; Bend your arm slightly. Measure from center back neck, across your shoulder, down to your elbow, down to your wrist.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hip:&lt;/strong&gt; Measure around the fullest part of your hips, inserting your forefinger between the tape and your hip to allow ease in fit.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inseam:&lt;/strong&gt; Measure a similar pant that fits you well. Measure along the inseam, from the crotch seam to the bottom of the hem.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;/div&gt;&#13;
&lt;div class="nofit"&gt;&#13;
&lt;h2&gt;Doesn't Fit?&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;If it doesn't fit, return it within 28 days, as long as it's unworn, unwashed and unaltered.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I convert a woman's size to a man's?&lt;/strong&gt; (and vice versa)&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Because every foot is different and its measurements are unique, we can't offer a recommendation for converting men's or women's footwear sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;a href="$url('Page-Show', 'cid', 'womens-footwear')$"&gt;Women's Size Chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, Mass. - Tuesday, April 26, 2005&lt;/span&gt; - Demandware, Inc., a leader in on-demand ecommerce solutions, today announced that Gardener's Supply, an employee-owned company serving millions of gardeners nationwide, has selected Demandware eCommerce to re-launch its website, Gardeners.com.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Gardener's Supply chose Demandware eCommerce because it provided built-in, revenue-generating features proven to lift conversion rates. "Ecommerce is our best performing channel and we had simply outgrown our old ecommerce vendor," said Max Harris, manager of electronic marketing, Gardener's Supply. "Demandware's on-demand solution ensures this won't happen again because we receive continuously enhanced features that provides superior functionality and eliminates the need for migration and upgrades."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;To begin the vendor selection process, Gardener's Supply created an internal task force to review 100 ecommerce sites and identified 20 new 'must have' revenue-driving features. Implementing these new features on its old platform would have been a prohibitively expensive and lengthy project. The company began an extensive search for an ecommerce partner to re-launch its site. While evaluating the top seven ecommerce vendors, Gardener's Supply found that traditional solutions - both packaged applications and those hosted with an application service provider (ASP) or outsourcer - lacked the most innovative features, required extensive customization, or were too expensive to operate.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;"Retailers that are seeking on-demand ecommerce software solutions will need to distinguish hype from reality," said Amy Konary, program director for Software Pricing, Licensing, and Delivery at IDC. "Software that is truly delivered on-demand is distinguished by characteristics such as unique pricing, development, and customization models that set on-demand apart from hosted packaged software."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Demandware understands that retailers want the ability to have control over their own site. Delivering Demandware eCommerce in a true on-demand model, the company provides its clients with visual programming tools so they are no longer at the mercy of their ecommerce vendor. With Demandware eCommerce, retailers can control of all aspects of their site - from user experience to functionality. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;"We chose Demandware's on-demand ecommerce solution because it provides the 'must have' features we identified, such as A/B testing, analytics, guided search, product configuration and the ability to manage multiple sites right out-of the-box," said Andrew Knight, Internet development manager at Gardeners.com. "We can now control and optimize any aspect of our site in-house using intuitive visual customization tools. Demandware provides us with a continuously evolving feature set, application upgrades, hosting, scalability and a team of experienced and dedicated engineers to handle issues that arise when running an ecommerce site - and all for just a small amount more than we were paying for hosting alone."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;"Demandware is simply the best ecommerce solution for multi-channel retailers like Gardener's Supply," said Stephan Schambach, president and CEO of Demandware. "We provide retailers with what they need - sophisticated ecommerce capabilities that they are in control of combined with the advantage of true on-demand, such as frequent functionality updates, broad scalability and predictable pricing. We provide Gardener's Supply with the ability to personalize and optimize their site daily."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Gardener's Supply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				Gardener's Supply was founded in 1983 by a handful of enthusiastic Vermont gardeners. Today, it serves millions of gardeners nationwide, offering everything from seed starting supplies and garden furniture to flower supports and greenhouses. Though the company has grown, it remains passionately committed to providing garden-tested, earth-friendly products that help its customers have more fun and success in their gardens. The new site will launch in late 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

Demandware eCommerce has advanced merchandising capabilities that will enhance our ability to offer our customers a compelling shopping experience.&amp;nbsp; And Tachyon has a unique ability to customize the software to meet our needs and seamlessly integrate it into our operations. With this combination, we can put control of our site back in our hands and optimize it on a daily basis to capitalize on trends and promotional opportunities." &lt;/p&gt;&#13;

				ecommerce solutions, today announced that The Vermont Teddy Bear&#13;
				Company (NASDAQ: BEAR) has selected Demandware's on-demand ecommerce&#13;
				platform to help lift conversion rates and increase sales while&#13;
				managing increased demand during seasonal spikes such as Valentine's&#13;
				Day.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;As a BizRate.com Circle of Excellence Platinum Award-Winner, Vermont&#13;
				Teddy Bear has been continually recognized by online shoppers as one of&#13;
				the "best of the best" online stores. With more than 50 percent of its&#13;
				annual revenue derived online, the company is adding new&#13;
				revenue-generating features to enhance the consumer experience and&#13;
				decrease shopping cart abandonment. Some of the planned features and&#13;
				functionality include advanced analytics to create targeted promotions,&#13;
				address validation to decrease operational expenses, and&#13;
				customer-facing features such as an arrival date calendar to ensure&#13;
				that the merchandise arrives on the specific requested dates. Vermont&#13;
				Teddy Bear plans to leverage Demandware eCommerce to create a bilingual&#13;
				site to market to Spanish-speaking audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;"We selected Demandware eCommerce because it is the only on-demand&#13;
				ecommerce platform that has all the advanced features that we require -&#13;
				without the hefty upfront costs typically associated with ecommerce&#13;
				software," said Tom Funk, Web Manager at Vermont Teddy Bear. "Further,&#13;
				Demandware eCommerce is architected and priced in a way that's&#13;
				attractive to holiday merchandisers like us, who experience substantial&#13;
				seasonal spikes in traffic. During our peak seasons - such as&#13;
				Valentine's Day - we process well over a thousand new orders per hour,&#13;
				and Demandware's infrastructure has the capacity to handle these&#13;
				seasonal peaks while providing a variable billing model that aligns&#13;
				with our business performance."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Vermont Teddy Bear evaluated packaged applications and other&#13;
				on-demand solutions and found that Demandware was the best total value&#13;
				package. Demandware delivers all of the advanced, revenue-generating&#13;
				features Vermont Teddy Bear needs to enhance its site - in one&#13;
				platform. Leveraging Demandware's unique partner model, Vermont Teddy&#13;
				Bear will work with Demandware certified partner PixelMEDIA to&#13;
				integrate its back-end systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;"It's an honor to have an award-winning ecommerce company such as&#13;
				Vermont Teddy Bear choose to partner with us to extend its competitive&#13;
				advantage," said Thomas Obrey, co-founder of PixelMEDIA. "The&#13;
				opportunity to help Vermont Teddy Bear improve upon its early success&#13;
				by leveraging best practices and the vast feature set of Demandware's&#13;
				on-demand ecommerce platform is exciting. The three organizations have&#13;
				already formed a highly collaborative relationship and we look forward&#13;
				to helping the company reach its business goals and maximize its online&#13;
				sales."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;"Our on-demand model complements Vermont Teddy Bear's seasonal sales&#13;
				cycle, providing the company with both the capacity and the full&#13;
				customization they require," said Stephan Schambach, president and CEO&#13;
				of Demandware. "Demandware guarantees that VermontTeddyBear.com will be&#13;
				able to handle orders during the crucial holiday months, while&#13;
				providing the company with visual programming tools to customize the&#13;
				site's features themselves - putting the control back in the hands of&#13;
				the merchandiser."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, Mass. - Monday, August 15, 2005&lt;/span&gt; - Demandware, Inc., a leader in on-demand&#13;
				ecommerce solutions, today announced that Ansel Adams Gallery has&#13;
				selected Demandware's on-demand ecommerce platform to enhance and scale&#13;
				its online gallery and store. Ansel Adams Gallery will go live on&#13;
				Demandware eCommerce in October of this year, just in time for the busy&#13;
				online holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Ansel Adams Gallery selected Demandware eCommerce because it was the&#13;
				most feature-rich solution on the market that also allowed the company&#13;
				to maintain the current design of the site. By enabling new&#13;
				revenue-generating capabilities, such as enhanced search and cross-sell&#13;
				promotions, the gallery's partnership with Demandware is anticipated to&#13;
				help dramatically improve conversion rates and increase the average&#13;
				order size online. In addition, Demandware's continuous software and&#13;
				feature upgrades appealed to Ansel Adams Gallery as it ensures the site&#13;
				will provide the best user experience possible as new features are&#13;
				added to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;"Demandware eCommerce is the only true, customizable on-demand&#13;
				platform that fit our business needs today while also demonstrating the&#13;
				ability to scale with us over the next three to five years," said&#13;
				Matthew Adams, president of Ansel Adams Gallery. "The internet gives us&#13;
				a platform from which we can reach customers worldwide, and a rich,&#13;
				well-organized, functioning site is key to imparting the trust we have&#13;
				built up over 100 years of doing business in Yosemite National Park. We&#13;
				anticipate that we can double our conversion rate this year resulting&#13;
				in more than 50% of the total revenue of the gallery coming from this&#13;
				increasingly important sales channel. We're delighted to be able to&#13;
				present the great work of America's best-known photographer online in a&#13;
				way that reflects the quality and integrity of the art, just like you'd&#13;
				discover by visiting the gallery itself."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&#13;
				&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Despite customers' praise for the current site design of&#13;
				AnselAdams.com, which was designed to marry the artistic elements of&#13;
				the products to a technical sales channel, the previous ecommerce&#13;
				platform had limited functionality, which hampered the organization's&#13;
				ability to maximize revenue from this important selling channel. Once&#13;
				it was determined that the rigid nature of the underlying technology&#13;
				infrastructure prevented easy customization to address these&#13;
				challenges, Ansel Adams Gallery conducted a review of the latest&#13;
				ecommerce platforms on the market. With the help of its IT services&#13;
				firm, Lincoln Peak (www.lincolnpeak.com), the choice of Demandware&#13;
				proved to be an easy one as the platform's continuous feature upgrades&#13;
				ensured the gallery's investment would benefit the organization for&#13;
				many years.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;"Demandware provides the latest features and functionality to its&#13;
				customers, as they become available, while also enabling Ansel Adams&#13;
				Gallery to control merchandising on a daily basis," said Rob Rosen,&#13;
				partner at Lincoln Peak. "This will be an important ecommerce&#13;
				initiative, as we marry the latest Internet technologies and features&#13;
				available through Demandware's platform with the classic photographs&#13;
				and works of Ansel Adams. We look forward to the partnership with both&#13;
				organizations as we enhance this wonderful online gallery and store." &lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;"AnselAdams.com is a perfect example of a growing online business&#13;
				that can benefit from an on-demand ecommerce platform," said Stephan&#13;
				Schambach, president and CEO, Demandware. "By having access to the&#13;
				latest revenue-generating features of our platform, the Gallery can&#13;
				maximize the online experience for each of its customers. Combined with&#13;
				the 'pay-as-you-go' pricing and guaranteed scalability associated with&#13;
				the on-demand approach, the Gallery is mitigating the risk and expense&#13;
				of this strategic initiative today, while successfully preparing for&#13;
				the future."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, Mass. - Monday, December 19, 2005&lt;/span&gt; - Demandware, Inc. (www.demandware.com), provider of the ecommerce platform that offers merchants the optimal combination of control, flexibility and a pay-as-you-go pricing model, has launched an advanced e-commerce website for Musician's Hut (&lt;a href="http://www.musicianshut.com"&gt;www.musicianshut.com&lt;/a&gt;). The site runs on Demandware eCommerce, a full-featured and customizable on-demand ecommerce platform. Demandware gives Musician's Hut complete control over online merchandising through a rich set of configuration and customization options, the flexibility needed to rapidly respond to evolving customer requirements, and the ability to minimize up-front operating costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;"Built by musicians for musicians," Musician's Hut is owned and operated by professional musicians with a vision for a new kind of musician-friendly, hyper-interactive, multi-channel source for musical instruments and equipment. The company has launched its Web site with a full line of top-brand drums and percussion equipment-including Pearl, Sabian, Latin Percussion, Gibraltar, Toca, and Zildjian-and will grow its offering over the coming year to comprise a complete music store selection, including  guitars, amps, keyboards, lighting, sound, DJ and recording equipment and more at competitive prices. Musician's Hut's vision is to combine the best brands, rich content and superior customer service to become "the guy musicians get their gear from," whether on the Web or in their retail stores. Demandware employed its unique partner model, teaming with Demandware certified implementation partner, Ixtens, to implement Musician's Hut's vision.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;"Musicians typically rely on the referrals of other musicians they know and trust when making their decisions-whether on an instrument, a piece of equipment, a supplier or even a band member. We needed to be able to reflect that community-based buying model on our site," said Musician's Hut CEO Eric Archuleta. "With Demandware, we were able to create a site that had a unique "music store" look and feel but also provided the underlying complex functionality and ecommerce conversion technology we needed to implement a community-based model, including wish lists, price matching, comparisons, product reviews and the ability to 'forward-to-a friend.'"&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;According to Achuleta, Musicians Hut's criteria for selecting its ecommerce platform included complete control over the appearance of the site to tailor it to appeal to musicians and avoid the "cookie-cutter" look other ecommerce platforms impose; advanced functionality to achieve the best possible customer experience; flexibility to respond to customer feedback and provide the nimbleness needed for a competitive edge; and the ability minimize operation costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;"Demandware's control, flexibility and a pay-as-you-go pricing model enabled us to easily meet Musician's Hut's unique requirements," said Stephan Schambach, CEO of Demandware. "The site's unique, musician-focused look and feel, community-based selling model and outstanding customer service were important to Musician's Hut, and Demandware provides features, customization capabilities and scalable capacity that make Musician's Hut's model work."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, Mass. - Monday, March 6, 2006&lt;/span&gt; - Demandware, Inc. (&lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com"&gt;www.demandware.com&lt;/a&gt;), provider of the Software as a Service (SaaS)-based ecommerce platform, today announced that it has initiated its second year of platform availability with the launch of an advanced ecommerce Website for Gardener's Supply Company (www.gardeners.com), the nation's top multi-channel marketer of gardening supplies. Since its product launch at Demo 2005, Demandware has demonstrated the appeal of its SaaS delivery model with 14 customers, providing them with access to the merchandising control, flexibility, functionality and interoperability of a full ecommerce application suite with the cost-effectiveness offered by a pricing model based on results.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Demandware's platform meets or beats our needs for smart direct marketing functionality with features such as Internal Search, a robust perpetual shopping cart, agile A/B testing and a solid core of site analytics,&amp;quot; said Max Harris, manager of electronic marketing for the Gardener's Supply Company parent company, America's Gardening Resource. &amp;quot;We're also very excited by their organic search 'friendliness' and the boost in performance we'll get from the scalable capacity they provide using their Software as a Service-based delivery model.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Harris cited the flexibility and control offered by the Demandware platform as his key criteria for selecting Demandware. Full control of the appearance of the site was essential to support the company's brand development, as was advanced functionality to achieve the best possible customer experience; flexibility to respond to customer feedback in a way that preserves the company's 'gardener to gardener' communications style; and the ability to scale capacity to accommodate peaks in activity.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Most of all,&amp;quot; Harris continued, &amp;quot;they have proven to be partners, not just vendors. They have been very open to our suggestions to enhance the platform and editing tools, and I'm confident they will constantly enhance the feature suite and efficiencies within the tool.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Demandware platform's control, flexibility and scalable capacity made it possible for us to easily support Gardener's Supply Company's sophisticated-and thus somewhat complex-online retail capabilities,&amp;quot; said Demandware CEO Stephan Schambach. &amp;quot;In the first year since the launch of our ecommerce platform, we have received validation from 15 customers-among them the top retail Websites-as well as our investors, who recently renewed their vote of confidence with a $12 million Series B round of funding. We believe the launch of the Gardener's Supply Company ecommerce site is the first success of many in the year ahead, and we look forward to an even more successful year of partnering with our customers to help them meet their online revenue and profitability objectives.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

The Demandware e-commerce platform provides retailers with an on-demand e-commerce environment for developing and delivering e-commerce sites. The report found that Demandware customers achieved rapid ROI by improving merchandising and increasing profits while decreasing ongoing and one-time implementation costs.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;According to the report, in the last decade many retailers have made significant investments in e-commerce software, consulting, development and infrastructure to address a burgeoning online customer channel. However, as e-commerce functionality rapidly evolves, retailers found that their existing platforms require significant investments of time and money in order to adopt new e-commerce innovations. Too, many existing platforms required infrastructure investment to support peak e-commerce traffic levels even during lower-volume periods, required significant consulting, development and integration costs for upgrades, and were unable to support multiple brands.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;The Nucleus Research report highlights how the on-demand e-commerce model addresses these issues. With a true on-demand delivery model, the vendor manages and supports its software externally and users access it using a Web browser or thin client; thus, multiple customers access a single instance of the application. Customers benefit from avoiding support costs as well as the vendor's ability to amortize the development, support, upgrade, and functionality improvement of the solution across multiple customers&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As the e-commerce marketplace continues to compete for increasingly sophisticated customers, the winning retailers will be those that keep infrastructure and other costs low while still innovating in strategies to attract, retain and convert customers,&amp;quot; said Rebecca Wettemann, vice president of research at Nucleus. &amp;quot;Our ROI evaluation report on Demandware's e-commerce platform found that retailers who wanted a sophisticated e-commerce environment that supported new functionality without the need to shoulder the cost of developing and supporting it themselves were able to do so with Demandware.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, Mass. - Wednesday, June 05, 2006&lt;/span&gt; - Bare Escentuals (&lt;a href="http://www.barescentuals.com"&gt;www.barescentuals.com&lt;/a&gt;), an innovative provider of natural cosmetics for the body and face, has selected Demandware (&lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com"&gt;www.demandware.com&lt;/a&gt;) to provide the ecommerce platform for its redesigned bareMinerals.com website.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Made of only pure crushed minerals from the earth, Bare Escentual's bareMinerals products are free of preservatives, talc, oil, fragrance and other potential skin irritants. Although especially beneficial to those concerned with skin sensitivities, allergies, scars, blemishes, rosacea, wrinkles and pigmentation, the bareMinerals formula provides impeccable coverage for every skin type and skin tone.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bare Escentuals is excited by the opportunity presented by the combined capabilities of Demandware and their development partner, Fluid,&amp;quot; says Myles McCormick, COO and CFO of Bare Escentuals. &amp;quot;With the relaunch of our site on the Demandware platform, we will have the highest levels of flexibility and control, enhancing our online reach and positioning.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;There were a number of reasons for Bare Escentuals to choose the Demandware platform. Key were the ability to manage multiple sites out-of the-box-enabling Bare Escentuals to repurpose its investment in its ecommerce platform across multiple sites; and the ability to update and optimize their site daily without the need for IT department resources to add or remove products, launch promotions, or perform any of the other tasks that are part of maintaining a world-class ecommerce presence. Selection criteria also included complete control over the appearance of the site to reflect the uniqueness and esthetic appeal of Bare Escentuals' products and avoid the &amp;quot;cookie-cutter&amp;quot; look other ecommerce platforms impose; advanced functionality to achieve the best possible customer experience; flexibility to respond to customer feedback and provide the nimbleness needed for a competitive edge; and the ability to minimize operation costs. With Demandware, Bare Escentuals has an ecommerce platform that can scale and grow with the company's business goals and requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Demandware will partner with innovative online retail solution provider Fluid Inc. to deliver Bare Escentual's bareMinerals site. Fluid will apply its expertise in developing compelling and cutting-edge retail websites to build the site on the Demandware platform. In addition, Fluid's Concept ConfigureT, a revolutionary product personalization and customization technology that branded manufacturers can use to offer personalized merchandise directly to consumers, will be used to further boost conversion rates and build brand loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bare Escentuals takes a caring, personal approach to meeting a very personal customer need, and the ability to customize every shopping experience to meet the needs of each individual was important,&amp;quot; said Demandware CEO Stephan Schambach. &amp;quot;Demandware offers a platform that will enable BareEscentuals to present its product in a manner consistent with their unique brand, but also will provide the flexibility, scalability and control to meet their needs as they launch additional specialty sites. They can easily customize their user's experience using our extensive library of best practice ecommerce processes and functionality and will have the benefit of continuous, automated feature upgrades that won't disrupt their business.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;					&lt;strong&gt;About Bare Escentuals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
					Since its founding in 1976, Bare Escentuals has focused on using only the finest ingredients in our products. This commitment led to the creation of our revolutionary mineral makeup called bareMinerals&amp;reg;. Made with crushed minerals from the earth, 100% pure bareMinerals are free of preservatives, talc, oil, fragrance and other potential skin irritants. All ages and skin types can benefit from our feather-light 100% pure bareMinerals, but especially those concerned with skin sensitivities, allergies, scars, blemishes, rosacea, wrinkles and pigmentation.

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, Mass. - Wednesday, June 20, 2006&lt;/span&gt; - Demandware (&lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com"&gt;www.demandware.com&lt;/a&gt;), today announced that international toy manufacturer and retailer Geobra Brandst&amp;auml;tter, owner of the PLAYMOBIL brand, has chosen the Demandware eCommerce platform on which to re-launch ten country-specific ecommerce sites. Demandware partner T-Systems Multimedia Solutions will develop and deliver the sites on the Demandware eCommerce platform.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Demandware provides an on-demand, Software-as-a Service (SaaS)-based enterprise-class ecommerce platform. This delivery model frees retailers from the need to purchase expensive hardware and software and automatically provides them with the latest ecommerce technology and best practices as they are made available. Demandware's on-demand model also makes it possible for retailers to manage products across multiple international sites while maintaining a consistent global brand: retailers can easily modify specific product attributes such as description and pricing, and further localize the site to comply with country-specific regulations, while maintaining a consistent look and customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;T-Systems Multimedia Solutions is part of T-Systems, a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG., and develops eBusiness solutions for both global corporations and small and medium-sized businesses. Demandware recently announced a comprehensive partnership agreement under which T-Systems will provide European hosting, implementation, consulting and design services to deliver turnkey ecommerce websites, deployed on the Demandware eCommerce platform, to European businesses and US-based companies that wish to launch international ecommerce sites. T-Systems will implement ten country specific eCommerce sites for PLAYMOBIL, with American sites hosted in the US and European sites hosted in Europe to conform with European data privacy standards.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We needed an ecommerce solution that would enable us to manage multiple international sites while maintaining a consistent global brand,&amp;quot; said Michael Konzmann, PLAYMOBIL Director of eCommerce. &amp;quot;Further, we needed a solution that could scale with our online retail channel and accommodate seasonal peaks in activity without requiring us to purchase expensive hardware and software. The combination of Demandware's flexible, scalable ecommerce platform with T-Systems' development, localization and hosting capabilities meets our specific merchandizing and global branding requirements while minimizing both our one-time and ongoing costs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, Mass. - Wednesday, June 20, 2006&lt;/span&gt; - Demandware (&lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com"&gt;www.demandware.com&lt;/a&gt;), today announced a comprehensive partnership agreement under which T-Systems will provide European hosting, implementation, consulting and design services to deliver turnkey ecommerce websites, deployed on the Demandware eCommerce platform, to European businesses and US-based companies that wish to launch international ecommerce sites. Demandware provides an on-demand, Software-as-a Service (SaaS)-based enterprise-class ecommerce platform. T-Systems, a leading European systems integrator with annual revenues of 12bn euros and a presence in over 20 countries, is a division of Deutsche Telekom AG. T-Systems recently became an investor in Demandware through its T-Systems Venture Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Demandware's unique Software-as-a-Service model frees retailers from the need to purchase expensive hardware and software and automatically provides them with the latest ecommerce technology and best practices as they are made available. Until recently, Demandware hosted European customers, including electronics giant Promarkt Online, from its US datacenter. Because European data privacy standards require hosting of eCommerce sites in-country, T-Systems will host Demandware's on-demand ecommerce platform in its European data centers. In addition, T-Systems will augment its substantial existing Demandware implementation and service capabilities through the hire and training of additional staff.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;According to a Forrester Research report, &amp;quot;Technology for Taking eCommerce Sales Abroad,&amp;quot; US retailers should leverage their existing ecommerce technology across borders and outsource areas that don't provide differentiation, such as the management of currency conversion, to ensure global consistency and control and provide differentiation against entrenched local sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There's a strong demand for the ability to manage multiple sites with different languages, pricing, currencies and more on a single ecommerce platform,&amp;quot; said Demandware CEO Stephan Schambach. &amp;quot;Due to technical or local staff limitations, US-based retailers who wish to have an ecommerce presence throughout Europe and European companies who wish to have a US ecommerce presence have had difficulty achieving this; one provider could not meet all of their ecommerce needs. Demandware's on-demand ecommerce model enables these international companies to host all of their sites on a single platform, and our partnership with T-Systems provides international companies with 'one-stop shopping' for all their platform, hosting, development, implementation and ongoing ecommerce requirements throughout the US and Europe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Joint customers include Promarkt Online and, most recently, Geobra Brandst&amp;auml;tter GmbH &amp;amp; Co. KG, maker of PLAYMOBIL, Germany's largest toy manufacturer. PLAYMOBIL distributes its toys in more than 60 countries and has subsidiaries in the United States, France, Great Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Greece, Spain, Canada and the Czech Republic. To provide PLAYMOBIL with a globally consistent brand while accommodating each county's specific requirements, T-Systems will develop and deploy ecommerce sites in ten different countries, many with multiple language, pricing and currency requirements, on a single Demandware platform.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We're convinced of the benefits of Demandware's on-demand ecommerce solution, and believe that the combination of Demandware's ecommerce platform and T-Systems' Multimedia Systems capabilities will further enable international retailers to focus on their core business, optimize processes, build online revenue streams and reduce costs--in other words, become more profitable,&amp;quot; said Dr. Klaus Radermacher, CEO of T-Systems Multimedia Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, Mass. &amp;ndash; Wednesday, Sept. 20, 2006&lt;/span&gt; &amp;ndash; Demandware (&lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com"&gt;www.demandware.com&lt;/a&gt;) announced today the company will provide free, automatic seasonal upgrades that deliver continuous eCommerce innovation and revenue-driving benefits to all customers each and every quarter. Demandware customers including Bare Escentuals, Gardener's Supply Company, Playmobil, and Sanrio gain new capabilities to differentiate their brand and improve the user experience with each shopping season. In this Fall release, Demandware has added new merchandising functionality to help retailers prepare for the 2006 Holiday Season. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&#13;
						&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
						&lt;strong&gt;New eCommerce Functionality for Fall Release&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
				With guidance from its customers, Demandware has added new merchandising features to its already rich eCommerce platform. Among the enhancements in this Fall release are faceted search, search engine optimization tools and new features that enable retailers to more effectively manage their assortment and market offers across multiple eCommerce sites. Benefits of these features are outlined below:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;UX Studio TM&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Demandware's User Experience (UX) Studio empowers a retailer's own web team with the ability to directly control the design and functionality of their eCommerce sites. UX Studio provides visual design tools, A/B split testing, a library of pre-built business objects, and support for Web 2.0 standards such as AJAX, CSS, and ECMA/JavaScript to free retailers from routine dependence on outside assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&#13;
						&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
					&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Faceted Search&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Demandware's eCommerce platform provides retailers with site search functionality that helps customers find merchandise quickly and easily. Search attributes are identified, segmented and intuitively filtered for drill down by any number of attributes such as style, color, size, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
						&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
					&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Search Engine Optimization Tools&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; In addition to its already robust Search Engine Optimization (SEO) tools for customizing page titles and spider-friendly URLs, Demandware has integrated Google Sitemaps, enabling eCommerce managers to directly feed site structure, content and metadata into Google's index.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&#13;
						&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
					&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Catalog Syndication&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Demandware has developed a new Catalog Syndication feature, enabling retailers to share any or all data from any catalog repository, across various storefronts. This eliminates the labor required to replicate and maintain product information as it is re-used for seasonal catalogs or across various brands.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
						&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
					&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Price Books&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash; Demandware's new Price Books feature allows merchants to vary pricing for the same item based on a customer group or catalog code. For example, retailers can vary prices for first-time visitors, return shoppers, for those referred by a shopping comparison engine, email campaign, affiliate site, wholesale buyers and more.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Demandware's flexible platform is allowing our business to push onsite search to the limit,&amp;quot; says Max Harris, Director of Ecommerce at America's Gardening Resource. &amp;quot;On every category page on our Dutch Gardens' site, we've customized faceted search to allow shoppers to instantly find the perfect selection based on color, growing zone, height, season of bloom, light requirements and more &amp;mdash; all with a single query. This has provided us with a search user interface customized to our livegoods product line, offering our customers a compelling alternative to traditional search and browsing paradigms. And Demandware's commitment to delivering new functionality each quarter, helps us stay ahead of the competition every season.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
						&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
						&lt;strong&gt;Riding the eCommerce Wave&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
					According to a recent Forrester Research report by eCommerce analyst Tamara Mendelsohn, 37% of North American and European enterprises that sell products or services online will either purchase or upgrade a commerce platform in 2006. &amp;quot;As companies push the limits of their eCommerce technologies to support multi-channel and international strategies, many are replacing their existing commerce platforms in the search for greater flexibility and scalability.&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Commerce Platforms: Build Or Buy?&amp;quot; Forrester, January 20, 2006).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We recognize that retailers need continual merchandising control, flexibility and adaptability in an eCommerce platform and as a result, we are providing seasonal enhancements to deliver benefits to our customers,&amp;quot; said Stephan Schambach, president and CEO of Demandware. &amp;quot;Each season, Demandware is updating our already feature-rich ecommerce platform, with new capabilities that help retailers service their customers online &amp;mdash; better and faster.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
						&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
						&lt;strong&gt;On-Demand eCommerce Delivers Seasonal Innovation&#13;
					with Lower Costs and Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Demandware's e-Commerce platform, a true on-demand service, provides a number of benefits to end users, including:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; Seasonal innovation via frequent hands-free upgrades&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; Rapid deployment and time to value&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; Reduced infrastructure costs&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; Increased control, flexibility, functionality and interoperability&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; No up front enterprise license fees or upgrades fees&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; High performance and availability without additional hardware requirements &lt;/li&gt;&#13;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Forrester Research analyst Tamara Mendelson touts the benefits of the service-oriented software model in her January 20, 2006 report, &amp;quot;Commerce Platforms: Build or Buy?&amp;quot; According to Mendelson, a service orientation &amp;quot;allows firms to achieve strategic advantage through custom business services that deliver value to customers while leveraging the lower cost and risk of a packaged solution.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&#13;
						&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
						&lt;strong&gt;Simplified Site Deployment and Management&#13;
					for Multi-brand Enterprise Customers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
					Demandware's eCommerce platform has several updated features that make it easy for retailers and integrators to maintain multiple sites. Well-defined interfaces, documentation and libraries of pre-built ecommerce functionality significantly reduce time to launch. In addition, Demandware provides customers with expert implementation services through partners such as USi, T-Systems and Fluid.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Toy manufacturer Playmobil is currently implementing Demandware with the help of European partner T-Systems and plans to re-launch ten international sites on the new technology. According to Playmobil Director of eCommerce, Michael Konzmann, &amp;quot;The way in which Demandware's platform is built and continually updated enables us to get our site up and running quickly and cost-effectively and reach our goal of providing our customers with the best service possible.&amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, Mass. - Tuesday, Oct. 17, 2006&lt;/span&gt; - Demandware (&lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com"&gt;www.demandware.com&lt;/a&gt;) announced today that Bare Escentuals (&lt;a href="http://www.bareescentuals.com"&gt;www.bareescentuals.com&lt;/a&gt;), has re-launched a new bareMinerals.com site using Demandware on demand e-Commerce platform. The new bareMinerals.com site improves the shopping experience for customers through an increased and better display of information. In addition, the site will feature improved online ordering, check-out and ability to upsell items. Demandware and Bare Escentuals teamed with interactive merchandising partner Fluid, Inc. (&lt;a href="http://www.fluid.com"&gt;www.fluid.com&lt;/a&gt;) to re-launch bareMinerals.com. Plans are also in the works to re-launch the BareEscentuals.com site on the Demandware platform in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;This upgrade adds a number of new merchandising features to bareMinerals.com using the Demandware e-Commerce platform, resulting in a richer user experience for customers. Blending content and commerce, bareMinerals.com now has an improved information display with additional content and graphics. The site also features new up sell capabilities that present customers with additional complementary products.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our goal with bareMinerals.com was to create the same personalized shopping experience our customers receive when shopping in-store at our Bare Escentuals boutiques or at other stores that carry our product such as Nordstrom, Sephora and Ulta,&amp;quot; said Diane Miles, President of Bare Escentuals. &amp;quot;Demandware enabled us to extend the same in-store, consultative quality of service to customers who prefer to engage with us over the internet at bareMinerals.com.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Bare Escentuals is a very successful, rapidly growing retailer with a powerful brand and extremely loyal fan base,&amp;quot; said Stephan Schambach, CEO of Demandware. &amp;quot;Our goal for this project was two-fold: to help Bare Escentuals better showcase their direct response collections, and to increase order size and conversion rates to position the company for future continued growth,&amp;quot; said Demandware CEO Stephan Schambach.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Bare Escentuals' beauty line includes i.d. bareMinerals and more than 1,000 other products in a complete line of color cosmetics, skin preps, lotions, application brushes and essential oils. Bare Escentuals products are sold in company-owned Bare Escentuals retail boutiques, on QVC and through TV infomercial, mail order, select specialty retailers like Sephora, Ulta and Nordstrom, plus high-end spas and international channels.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, Mass. &amp;ndash; November 8, 2006&lt;/span&gt; &amp;ndash;  Demandware (&lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com"&gt;www.demandware.com&lt;/a&gt;) announced today that the company is one of 12 innovative Software as a Service (SaaS) companies that was chosen to present at the Software &amp;amp; Information Industry Association&amp;rsquo;s (SIIA) On Demand conference.  Demandware&amp;rsquo;s on demand ecommerce solution was selected by the SIIA board of directors as an example of innovative delivery of enterprise class software as an on demand service.  Founder, president and CEO of Demandware Stephan Schambach will present, &amp;ldquo;eCommerce On-Demand: Advancing The Boundaries of SaaS&amp;rdquo; at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday, November 9, 2006.  Several hundred Internet service and platform vendors, venture capitalists, financial analysts and other SaaS thought leaders will attend the SIIA On Demand conference, which is being held at the Dolce Hayes Mansion in San Jose, CA.  Other speakers on the agenda include SalesForce.com, IBM, HP and Microsoft. For more information, visit http://www.siia.net/ondemand.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;According to a recent Gartner research report, Software as a Service (SaaS) will constitute 25 percent of new business software delivered by 2011 (&amp;quot;On Premise Software Will Be Challenged By SaaS Software Delivery,&amp;rdquo; September 26, 2006).  The popularity of SaaS is growing because the solution offers a number of benefits to end users.  &amp;ldquo;SaaS&amp;rsquo;s ability to offer quicker deployments with no or low upfront costs means quicker time to value and lower risk to the buyer,&amp;rdquo; wrote Forrester Research analysts Liz Herbert and Frank E. Gillett in their  September 1, 2006 &amp;ldquo;Software-As-A-Service: An Executive Primer&amp;rdquo; report.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s fierce competitive environment, retailers need to constantly maintain their brand integrity and online presence to make sure it is consistent across channels.  Demandware applies the continual innovation and cost benefits of a Software as a Service delivery model to the retail industry with its flexible ecommerce solution. Demandware uniquely provides its customers with:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full merchant control of the storefront and user experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
				Utilizing Demandware&amp;rsquo;s Business Manager and UX Studio&amp;trade;, merchants can easily implement any design, promotion or site feature, any time &amp;ndash; without the routine dependence on outside resources.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free, automatic seasonal upgrades.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
					Demandware delivers additional ecommerce capabilities to retailers on a frequent basis, without additional cost. This allows merchants to focus more of their time and resources on brand differentiation, rather than commodity features and software version upgrades. (See the September 20, 2006 Demandware announcement: &lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com/news/articles/2006_09_20.php"&gt;http://www.demandware.com/news/articles/2006_09_20.php&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On demand scalability and performance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
				Demandware&amp;rsquo;s robust, multi-tenant architecture delivers enterprise-class performance and dynamically provisions additional capacity along the grid to accommodate traffic peaks. There is no need for merchants to plan and pay for unused data center capacity ahead of demand. Merchants pay only for what is needed, when it&amp;rsquo;s needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The unspoken secret of enterprise software is that for every $1 you spend in license, there is an additional $8 in related costs for hardware, implementation, integration and maintenance,&amp;rdquo; said Demandware founder, president and CEO Stephan Schambach.  &amp;ldquo;eCommerce is particularly consumptive given the constant innovation in the industry.  However, if you can handle this with a single subscription fee like Demandware offers, you can redeploy your resources toward creating brand distinction and differentiation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, Mass. &amp;ndash; December 13 &amp;ndash; 2006&lt;/span&gt; &amp;ndash; Demandware (&lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com"&gt;www.demandware.com&lt;/a&gt;), developer of a true on-demand ecommerce solution for retailers, announced today the availability of a new podcast on how to improve online customer experience. Listen to Stephan Schambach, Founder, President and CEO of Demandware cover topics such as site search and navigation in this 15 minute podcast available at &lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com/webinars"&gt;http://www.demandware.com/webinars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Navigation and search is enormously important for converting window shoppers into buyers,&amp;quot; said Schambach. &amp;quot;Navigation today means that you have search and catalog navigation integrated into a faceted-search mechanism that allows people to initially indicate their interest by clicking on a catalog category or by just putting in a search term.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;With online holiday sales reaching unprecedented highs this year, more and more businesses plan to upgrade their ecommerce site to a more robust platform capable of high performance and scalability with features such as site search, and enhanced promotion and merchandising functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;The evidence of what is driving this trend is clear: according to comScore Networks, Cyber Monday on December 4th was the heaviest ecommerce day on record with $647 million spent, a 26-percent increase versus the corresponding day last year.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

The report is underwritten by Demandware, a provider of an on demand eCommerce platform that delivers quick ROI to retailers.

				&lt;p&gt;The study helps retailers learn about how to maximize return on eCommerce investment, and improve comparable year over year sales, customer conversion rates and average order value. Use of web analytics and personalization of web sites surfaced as top initiatives in the report for online merchants. More than 44% of firms use web analytics to evaluate customer behavior. Yet, 59% of B2C firms make this data actionable by strategically up-selling and cross-selling products using personalized collaborative filtering, also known as affinity selling. Additionally, companies personalizing homepages and delivering targeted content are recognizing the most value from their analytical evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Best-in-Class retailers today are increasingly sophisticated in the ways that they monitor online customer behavior through analytics and utilize that information to feed personalization back to their customer facing applications,&amp;quot; says John Lovett, Research Analyst for Aberdeen's B2C eCommerce practice. &amp;quot;The report illustrates that 65% of successful retailers deploy applications such as search and analytics to personalize sites for unique customers and customer segments to improve the experience and the bottom line.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

				&lt;p&gt;Following an extensive evaluation of eCommerce platforms, Playboy.com partnered with Demandware to deliver differentiated customer shopping experiences based on the strength of Demandware&amp;rsquo;s merchandising capabilities, including:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt;AJAX shopping cart &amp;ndash; The shopping cart allows customers to access and view their shopping basket at any time without having to click through to checkout, eliminating the disjointed steps of having to press &amp;ldquo;Add to Cart,&amp;rdquo; and then &amp;ldquo;Continue Shopping&amp;rdquo; to get back to the previous page and main shopping area.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; Ability to add entire outfits to shopping cart at once - Customers can now buy an entire outfit with ease and add multiple items to their cart at once. This feature was added to drive more items per order and ultimately drive-up the AOV (Average Order Value).&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; Checkout incentives and offers &amp;ndash; Shoppers are informed at checkout how close they are to receiving an offer (e.g. free shipping over a certain amount) and whether they meet the minimum threshold before completing their order. Playboy.com can set different thresholds on the average order spend for these messages.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playboy.com Leverages Demandware Platform to Launch Sites Within Weeks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
				Following the launch of ShoptheBunny.com, Playboy.com was able to relaunch PlayboyStore.com in a matter of weeks. Using Demandware merchandising tools and User Experience (UX&amp;trade;) Studio design environment, Playboy.com leveraged its initial Demandware eCommerce site architecture, product content, and price repositories to relaunch the new site quickly. And, as with all Demandware customers, Playboy.com expanded its eCommerce businesses without the hassle of buying additional software licenses.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Playboy.com&amp;rsquo;s success is part of a larger trend where major companies leverage their brand equity and the online channel to open new businesses,&amp;rdquo; said Jamus Driscoll, vice president of marketing, Demandware. &amp;ldquo;Through the combination of its merchandising capabilities and platform extensibility, Demandware makes it easy for global brands like Playboy to target specific customer demographics with refined brand messages.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;Given the promise of multi-channel retailing for increasing customer relationships and revenues, it certainly makes sense for merchants to move their operations in that direction. Within any multi-channel strategy, however, one of the largest, most fundamental building blocks is a subset of so-called consumer direct operations that enables customers to bypass store-based retail. While these operations are necessary for achieving multi-channel retailing, the complexities inherent in consumer direct models can present some unexpected hurdles especially for traditional brick and mortar stores and branded manufacturers. To meet the challenges, merchants will need the ability to implement customer direct models that allow them to retain brand control while outsourcing costly and time-consuming tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Because consumer direct models are, by nature, remote, the operational process of satisfying customers via these channels is very different than it is in stores. It requires operational experience and core capabilities such as customer interaction centers, e-commerce storefronts and order management, to name a few. Where direct marketers, like catalogers and pure-play e-commerce retailers, have oriented around servicing the individual with call centers and fulfillment warehouses optimized to ship individual orders, traditional store-based retailers and branded manufacturers often find these functions require significant development.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;As a result, traditional stores and branded manufacturers with no history of serving individual customers remotely face new merchandizing and operational challenges. They must create a great deal of content on each product and re-merchandise their inventory for a different audience. They need response teams and/or call centers customers can contact directly for order information or questions, as well as fulfillment operations. In addition, the content, call center and e-commerce channels must all be on the same page.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, merchants implementing consumer direct models have either done it themselves in house (designing the business processes, building/integrating applications) or outsourced everything. Unfortunately, both of these approaches have serious drawbacks and represent uneasy compromises in the consumer direct world.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Do-it-yourself approaches might ensure brand control, but they are costly, and time consuming. These approaches not only involve the headache and expense of staffing, handling the warehouse and running all of the operations, but more importantly, require retailers to operate outside of their area of core expertise, which is merchandising and managing customer relationships. While very large retailers may have the resources for such operations, few small and medium size businesses do.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Outsourcing of the whole operation might save the time, cost and trouble of do-it-yourself approaches, but effectively cedes control of the brand to a third party. This includes control of the merchandising, which is the heart and soul of the brand. In essence, the third party takes over control of the day-to-day customer relationship activities that are critical to promoting product brand value and differentiation to targeted customers. Merchants who lose their core brand in this way will never achieve true multi-channel retailing or reap its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Clearly, retailers need a new approach that allows them to retain control of their brands (primarily through e-commerce backed up by content/catalogues), while outsourcing the logistics/call centers. In this scenario, retailers control the rules and merchandizing, but outsource the complex processes associated with executing comprehensive consumer direct deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Today, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) enabled commerce is emerging as the most viable means for building the kind of solid customer direct models necessary for true multi-channel retailing. The availability of a broader scope of SaaS capabilities including order management and e-commerce provides the right blend of in-sourced merchandising control and the advantages of selective business process and/or IT outsourcing. In this model, merchants can control the user experience, set promotions and pricing calendars, and keep online storefronts current with the latest and best merchandizing techniques to drive conversion and higher order values. SaaS also can increase brand loyalty by improving direct sales response; lower total cost of ownership by moving from fixed to variable costs; and improve productivity by leveraging existing resources more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;With the ability of well-executed, multi-channel retailing to positively impact the bottom line for merchants, the trend toward implementing these strategies is likely to continue for some time. But unless the consumer direct component is done correctly, a large piece of the multi-channel operation will be missing. Solid consumer direct models that offload complexities, while keeping brand and merchandizing control in the hands of retailers, are vital to making good on the multi-channel promise.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Stephan Schambach is President and CEO of Demandware, a Woburn, MA-based provider of e-commerce systems that provide merchandising control.&lt;/p&gt;</custom-attribute>

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, Mass. - May 29, 2007&lt;/span&gt; - Demandware, developer of the leading On-Demand eCommerce Platform, today announced a partnership with Bazaarvoice to give merchants the ability to incorporate consumer-generated content for more effective merchandising and improved conversion rates. With Bazaarvoice, Demandware customers will be able to leverage powerful product ratings and review functionality and their recently launched Ask &amp;amp; Answer&amp;trade; service to build merchandising driven eCommerce sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Social merchandising is the wave of the future,&amp;quot; said Stephan Schambach, founder and chairman of Demandware. &amp;quot;Bazaarvoice will enable us to help our customers convert browsers to buyers by incorporating powerful consumer input into the merchandising process.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;According to a recent Jupiter Research study, seventy-seven percent of online shoppers employ user-generated reviews and ratings when making purchase decisions,&amp;quot; said Bazaarvoice founder and CEO Brett Hurt. &amp;quot;By coupling our leading social commerce capabilities with Demandware's exceptional merchandising capabilities, retailers can count on much higher conversion rates and an improved customer experience.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bazaarvoice Ratings &amp;amp; Reviews&amp;trade;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				Now Demandware customers can leverage Bazaarvoice's managed solution for enabling, encouraging, and monitoring online consumer ratings and reviews.

				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bazaarvoice Ask &amp;amp; Answer&amp;trade;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
				The hosted and fully managed Ask &amp;amp; Answer service integrates with the Demandware eCommerce platform to allow customers to share product information with other customers online. Ask &amp;amp; Answer taps the power of online communities to address the unanswered questions that can stop a purchase and send a visitor to a competing site. The new service is built on the industry-leading Bazaarvoice platform and is the first to encourage shoppers to post and respond to specific questions about products and services directly alongside standard product information for more effective merchandising. In addition to providing a compelling customer experience with Bazaarvoice, Demandware provides a full range of best-in-class eCommerce capabilities to online merchants for driving online revenue.

Demandware has also signed several technology partnerships with vendors Allurent, BazaarVoice, and PowerReviews and launched a Client Success Program to help retailers achieve merchandising excellence.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Leading brands are utilizing the Demandware eCommerce Platform for its industry-leading merchandising capabilities designed to empower merchants to deliver the right products and offers to customers, increase online sales, and improve the customer experience. Beauty retailer Bare Escentuals went live with a new bareMinerals.com site on Demandware in Fall 2006, and is also currently working to re-launch their entire BareEscentuals.com site on Demandware.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Demandware enabled us to easily modify and extend the same in-store merchandising to customers who prefer to engage with us over the Internet,&amp;quot; said Sarah Veit, Director of Web Marketing at Bare Escentuals. &amp;quot;Their merchandising capabilities and services allow us to sell products online in innovative new ways.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Demandware eCommerce Platform Industry Leading Merchandising Product Functionality Demandware has added a new promotions rules engine to its eCommerce Platform with 30 new promotion types including unique options such as surprise and delight loyalty-based offers.

All this robust search functionality is fully integrated with the product catalog to allow real-time editing for accurately displaying the right products and information to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, Mass. - June 7, 2007&lt;/span&gt; - Demandware (&lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com"&gt;www.demandware.com&lt;/a&gt;), developer of the breakthrough On-Demand eCommerce Platform, announced today that international toy manufacturer and retailer Geobra Brandst&amp;auml;tter, owner of the popular Playmobil brand, has re-launched ten international web sites using Demandware in only six months. Demandware was chosen to support a quick international expansion into new markets while maintaining a consistent brand. Countries include the United States, Canada, France, Switzerland, England, Austria, Belgium, Spain, Italy and Greece. Demandware teamed with German implementation partner T-Systems (www.tsystems.com), a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom AG., to re-launch the Playmobil sites, and additional plans are in the works to launch in more countries in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We partnered with Demandware to gain multi-site and multi-language capabilities and be able to better serve our customers,&amp;quot; said Michael Konzmann, Playmobil Director of eCommerce. &amp;quot;We can now continually update our site with new innovations around the seasonal holidays and easily handle spikes in traffic.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;As a toy manufacturer, Playmobil traditionally has strong seasonal fluctuations in the number of visitors to its website, especially around the holidays. Demandware's technology is well suited to large fluctuations in traffic, and saves Playmobil the high availability costs associated with IT hardware and software. In addition, Playmobil subsidiaries managing Playmobil.com can now easily modify specific product attributes such as description, and further localize the site to comply with country-specific regulations, while maintaining a consistent look and customer experience. Lastly, the following Demandware features, designed to improve the visitor experience, are now available on the re-launched Playmobil.com sites:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; Replacement Parts Service - lost toy parts of all sizes such as wooden spoons, saddles, motor bike axles and police hats can be re-ordered&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; Email Postcards - visitors can send postcards featuring different Playmobil toys to friends and family&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; Wish Lists - customers select their favorite items and build wish lists&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; Seasonal Campaigns/Features - interactive games and activities for different holidays to keep users on the site. For example, there was a Christmas calendar featured this past December where visitors could open different doors to find hidden surprises&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Playmobil is a perfect example of a successful brand looking to expand in today's competitive market,&amp;quot; said Stephan Schambach, founder and chairman of Demandware. &amp;quot;Demandware gives retailers and manufacturers a way to quickly reach new customers in international markets and achieve their revenue goals.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

					&lt;li&gt; Low Risk with a reliable, on-demand platform that scales to meet seasonal peaks in traffic&lt;/li&gt;&#13;

Demandware founder and chairman Stephan Schambach will discuss how retail eCommerce solutions are helping retailers innovate, increase market share and boost gross margin at the event, which will be held on June 12, 2007 at the Citigroup Center in New York City. Schambach will be joined by leading retail equity research analyst Deb Weinswig of Citigroup, technology analyst Paula Rosenblum of Retail Systems Alert Group, in addition to executives from J.C. Penney, Kenneth Cole, SAP, Microsoft, and SAS.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;The Citigroup Retail Technology Conference provides participants with an overview of how retailers have benefited from current retail technology and how these solutions will impact the future of the retail industry. Demandware's presentation will focus on the fastest growing segment of retail - the online channel. As spending continues to increase and more sophisticated consumers become multi-channel shoppers, today's leading retailers must engage the right technology partners and find solutions like Demandware to meet the demanding needs of consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A new and innovative approach to eCommerce must be considered as part of any retail growth strategy especially considering the tremendous increase over the past year in cross channel consumer spending,&amp;quot; said Schambach. &amp;quot;The Citigroup Retail Technology Forum is a great opportunity for us to convene with innovative retailers and share trends that are driving the retail industry forward.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, Mass. - July 19, 2007&lt;/span&gt; - Demandware (&lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com"&gt;www.demandware.com&lt;/a&gt;), developer of the breakthrough On-Demand eCommerce Platform, today announced that Sally Beauty Supply has selected the Demandware platform to create an ecommerce site at www.sallybeauty.com. The site will integrate with Sally Beauty's current loyalty and other in-store programs at its 2,200 US stores and provide a cross-channel experience for Sally Beauty customers. Scheduled to go live in advance of the 2007 holiday season, the new sallybeauty.com will feature advanced merchandising, promotion and search capabilities - including integration with Sally Beauty's loyalty card program.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Sally Beauty is partnering with Demandware to meet its business goals of expanding into a new online channel to better meet its customers' needs. Sally Beauty chose the Demandware platform because of its advanced merchandising capabilities and successful history launching sites for other major brands including Bare Escentuals and Playmobil.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Sally Beauty also selected Demandware because its on-demand ecommerce model eliminates unnecessary hardware, IT and staffing expenses. Demandware is the best solution for retailers looking to leverage best of breed merchandising capabilities, ensure high availability for seasonal peaks in traffic, and lower maintenance costs while keeping the site current in order to remain competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Creating an on-line shopping component will offer our customers an additional way to shop -- at home and at times when it is most convenient for them,&amp;quot; said Mike Spinozzi, president of Sally Beauty Supply. &amp;quot;The ecommerce site will also showcase Sally Beauty's wide assortment of professional hair and beauty supplies along with detailed product information, helping our customer choose the best solution for her specialized needs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A true cross-channel endeavor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
				The new ecommerce site to be launched on the Demandware platform will be integrated into Sally Beauty Supply's current site creating a seamless online experience for customers. As part of the launch, Sally Beauty is implementing two unique cross-channel programs:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; Differential pricing linked with loyalty program - Demandware's flexible pricing engine will allow Sally Beauty to customize item prices based on two different loyalty programs.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt; Online sales that augment store service capabilities - Sally Beauty sales associates in the company's more than 2,200 stores will be encouraged to improve customer satisfaction and sales growth by promoting online shopping.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;One of our key goals at Sally Beauty is to continue to enhance our customer's shopping experience,&amp;quot; Spinozzi explains. &amp;quot;And providing our customer with another avenue to help solve their hair product needs will provide an additional layer of service and convenience for the shopper.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
					&lt;li&gt;&amp;quot;We are pleased that Sally Beauty has chosen Demandware to implement an ecommerce program that incorporates multi-channel thinking, enabling the entire organization to truly benefit from successful web-based sales,&amp;quot; says Stephan Schambach, founder and chairman of Demandware. &amp;quot;Sally Beauty is on target to capture incremental sales and market share while improving customer service levels.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, Mass. - September 12, 2007&lt;/span&gt; - Demandware (&lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com" class="basic" TITLE="Demandware :: Enterprise eCommerce Software With Full Merchandising Control"&gt;www.demandware.com&lt;/a&gt;), Demandware, developer of the breakthrough On-Demand eCommerce Platform, today announced the creation of a new Client Advisory Board (CAB). The first meeting of the CAB will be September 16-17, 2007 at the Signature Hotel at MGM Grand in Las Vegas, NV. This inaugural meeting will take place the two days prior to the Shop.org Annual Summit, the premier gathering of online and multichannel retailers.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Demandware CAB is comprised of a hand-selected group of senior business executives, with a maximum of 2 executives from each client company. CAB members will help shape the future direction of Demandware’s business strategy and product roadmap, and will have the opportunity to meet with peers in a small group setting. Founding members are from companies including Bare Escentuals, America’s Gardening Resource and Playboy.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;“The Demandware Client Advisory Board presents a unique forum for our clients to meet with Demandware executives and with each other,” notes Stephan Schambach, chairman and founder, Demandware. “Participation will be limited to a hand-selected group of senior Demandware client executives – all from high-growth brands. Participants will have the opportunity to meet with peers and industry experts to discuss common challenges, strategies and successes.”&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The inaugural meeting will include a full agenda of case studies, workshops and networking events. The meeting will kick off on Sunday, September 16, 2007 with golf and other exciting outdoor activities, followed by a networking reception and dinner. The business meeting and workshops will begin Monday morning September 17, 2007 with a Demandware company update, followed by a session covering the company’s product and services strategy. Following lunch, participants can attend retailer case study sessions and roundtable discussions to help each other maximize their use of the Demandware platform.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;CAB members will be encouraged to stay in Las Vegas to attend the Shop.org Summit, for which Demandware is a Platinum Sponsor. During an eCommerce clinic at the Shop.org conference, Julian Chu, director of Demandware’s Client Success Program, will lead a discussion on “Delivering a Seamless Customer Experience: Effective Execution of Multi-Channel Promotions.” Bare Escentuals’ director of web marketing Sarah Veit and retail industry expert Kirthi Kalyanam, director of Internet Retailing at Santa Clara University, also will participate in the session scheduled to take place on Wednesday, September 19 from 1:15-2:15pm PST in Mandalay Bay Ballroom K &lt;/p&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, Mass. - September 17, 2007&lt;/span&gt; - Demandware (&lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com" class="basic" title="Demandware :: Enterprise eCommerce Software With Full Merchandising Control"&gt;www.demandware.com&lt;/a&gt;), developer of the breakthrough On-Demand eCommerce platform, today announced that it is the first and only eCommerce platform provider to achieve Payment Card Industry (PCI) Compliance certification for the latest version of the standard, PCI Data Security Standard (DSS) version 1.1.  This new standard sets more stringent requirements for hosted providers handling and processing credit card data on behalf of third parties. Demandware has partnered with Security Metrics to perform the on-site audit of the Demandware eCommerce Platform. &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;According the Federal Trade Commission, credit card fraud (25%) was the most common form of reported identity theft in 2006. More than $48 billion was lost by financial institutions and businesses in that year due to identity theft, and $5 billion lost by individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;By working with Demandware, retailers are assured that their eCommerce platform provider enables their businesses to adhere with PCI standards for data security and reliability and avoid jeopardizing important customer data and hefty fines. The Payment Security Standards Council has mandated that a company processing, storing, or transmitting credit card numbers must be PCI Data Security Standard (DSS) compliant or risk losing the ability to process credit card payments through the major credit card companies.  Organizations that fail to comply risk not being allowed to handle cardholder data and fines up to $500,000 if the data is lost or stolen.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;"Now more than ever, it’s critical that companies take every measure possible to protect the security and integrity of their customer data," notes senior security analyst and certified information system security professional (CISSP) Gary Glover at Demandware’s security partner Security Metrics. "By partnering with Demandware, customers can have confidence that their ecommerce businesses can be compliant with the highest standards of integrity and security."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;b&gt;Demandware Only Provider to Meet New Mandatory PCI Standards for Hosted Commerce&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Demandware has met the PCI DSS version 1.1 set of comprehensive requirements for enhancing payment account data security, developed by the founding payment brands of the PCI Security Standards Council, including American Express, MasterCard Worldwide and Visa International, to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures on a global basis.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The PCI DSS version 1.1 is a multifaceted security standard that includes requirements for security management, policies, procedures, network architecture, software design and other critical protective measures.   Demandware has proven it can meet the rigorous PCI Compliance standard to help organizations proactively protect customer account data.&lt;/p&gt;  &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;"Adhering to PCI standards is of the utmost importance for all retailers," said Wayne Whitcomb, vice president of engineering and technology at Demandware. "Demandware recognizes this, and gives our customers the peace of mind of a secure online platform."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, MA - October 01, 2007 &lt;/span&gt; - Demandware (&lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com" class="basic" title="Demandware :: Enterprise eCommerce Software With Full Merchandising Control"&gt;www.demandware.com&lt;/a&gt;), developer of the breakthrough On-Demand eCommerce Platform, today announced its customers Playboy Enterprises and Bare Escentuals are two of 12 retail industry leaders who are receiving Fusion Awards for their success in transforming their businesses with technology advancements. Playboy was honored as a leading multichannel retailer for its shopthebunny.com site launch and the re-launch of playboystore.com on the Demandware eCommerce platform, and Bare Escentuals was recognized for its successful cross-channel integration. &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Playboy and Bare Escentuals are joined by an impressive roster of retailers receiving Fusion Awards including Best Buy, JCPenney and Borders, among others. Playboy and Bare Escentuals will receive RIS News Fusion Awards during a ceremony to be held at the RIS Cross-Channel Summit, September 30–October 2, 2007 at the Four Seasons Troon North in Scottsdale, Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;"Playboy and Bare Escentuals are industry leaders transforming their business through comprehensive and innovative cross-channel strategies," said Stephan Schambach, chairman and founder, Demandware. "Demandware is proud to help them — and all customers — expand their eCommerce businesses."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playboy launches into increased sales&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
To win the RIS Fusion award, Playboy demonstrated excellence in recent site launches with Demandware. Playboy eCommerce successfully launched &lt;a href="http://www.shopthebunny.com" target="_blank" title="www.shopthebunny.com"&gt;www.shopthebunny.com&lt;/a&gt;, an apparel business targeting a female demographic, and the company also re-launched its flagship business, &lt;a href="http://www.playboystore.com" target="_blank" title="www.playboystore.com"&gt;www.playboystore.com&lt;/a&gt;, on the Demandware platform. Following these implementations, average order value (AOV) increased eight percent and customer conversion increased two percent.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
"With Demandware’s help we have seen an uplift in sales," noted Danielle Savin, division vice president of eCommerce, Playboy.com. "Demandware offers a flexible backend management tool, an Ajax in-line shopping cart and the ability to create micro-sites on the fly with no additional cash outlay. We also were pleased that the Demandware platform allowed Playboy’s eCommerce team to have complete control over every aspect of the application including the ability to A/B test any aspect of the store." &#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bare Escentuals demonstrates multichannel magic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&#13;
Bare Escentuals was honored by RIS for its ability to successfully move customers from one channel to another with consistent brand messaging. To aid in that effort, the company recently re-launched its bareMinerals.com and BareEscentuals.com sites using the Demandware e-Commerce Platform. Designed to provide an improved shopping experience, the sites offer a number of enhanced online merchandising features including more efficient online ordering and checkout, as well as a focus on upselling items.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent seminar covering online merchandising best practices, Sarah Veit, director of Web marketing for Bare Escentuals commented, "Our overriding principle is to do what’s right for the customer. We really focused on conversion. We wanted to address the customer’s goals – what she wants to accomplish when she comes to our site."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The sites were designed to recreate the personalized service customers receive when they purchase Bare Escentuals products in boutiques and upscale department stores such as Nordstrom, Sephora and Ulta.&lt;/p&gt; &#13;

The joint solution provides multi-channel retailers and consumer brands with seamless integration between their online and offline businesses, improving customer experiences across channels.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;"Customers increasingly expect not only a seamless buying experience across channels, but an integrated and unified service experience, whether online, via email, or over the phone," explained Rob Garf, vice president and general manager of Retail Strategies at AMR Research, in a retail note published in October 2007.  "This partnership should bridge the gap between these two needs that now exists in the marketplace, helping retailers get close to the ultimate goal of a seamless cross-channel experience through each point of interaction."&lt;/p&gt;  &#13;
 &#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Through this combination of CRM and eCommerce, clients can deliver a consistent experience across the complete customer lifecycle, from awareness and acquisition through conversion and support – regardless of how consumers interact with the company.  Throughout the customer lifecycle, clients maintain a single view of the customer and can leverage uniform product and support content, pricing and promotions, business processes, and interaction channels.&lt;/p&gt;  &#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;"Consumers are driving unprecedented change in our industry," said Jason Mittelstaedt, vice president of marketing at RightNow. "Whether they go online or call a company, they expect a consistent personalized customer experience. This joint solution breaks new ground and will give organizations many more ways to proactively engage with consumers, which in turn increases conversion rates and fosters brand loyalty."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;The new enterprise mash-up connects RightNow’s service, marketing and sales applications with Demandware’s web platform and eCommerce services.  RightNow will provide an in/outbound sales and service desktop, multi-channel customer service, marketing communications, and customer feedback capabilities.  Demandware will provide the eCommerce platform, including the online storefront, site search, guided navigation, product catalog and promotions, web development environment, user profiles and online content.&lt;/p&gt; &#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;"Web 2.0 and the realization of true services-oriented architectures have fundamentally reshaped how enterprise applications are integrated and delivered," said Jamus Driscoll, vice president of marketing, Demandware. "With RightNow and Demandware, retailers have the power of an integrated, end-to-end solution for selling and servicing the consumer across channels, all offered as an on-demand service."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, MA - December 12, 2007 &lt;/span&gt; - Demandware  &lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com" class="basic" title="Demandware developer of the breakthrough On-Demand eCommerce Platform"&gt;(www.demandware.com)&lt;/a&gt;, developer of the breakthrough On-Demand eCommerce Platform, today announced the launch of Timberland’s UK site: &lt;a href="http://www.timberlandonline.co.uk" class="basic" title="The Timberland Company is a global leader in the design and marketing of premium-quality footwear"&gt;www.timberlandonline.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;. Part of Timberland’s strategic push into international markets, the new site offers UK shoppers the ability to buy Timberland products directly from the web. Reporting approximately $1.6 billion in revenue in 2006, The Timberland Company designs and markets premium-quality footwear, apparel and accessories to consumers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;  &#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;After a lengthy evaluation process involving multiple solution providers, Timberland’s international eCommerce team chose Demandware for its advanced merchandising functionality, the simplicity it offers for running multiple country-specific sites from a single platform and for the control and capabilities it delivered to Timberland’s in-house web merchandising teams.&lt;/p&gt; &#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;"We needed an eCommerce partner who could help our international business extend across multiple brands and geographies," said Troy Brown, senior director and general manager, eCommerce, The Timberland Company. "Demandware gave our eCommerce team the platform we needed to drive our growth."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovative Architecture Delivers eCommerce Freedom and Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;Demandware’s extensive partner ecosystem and Timberland’s preferred vendors combined to deliver an integrated solution, comprised of custom development and best-of-breed technologies to achieve key eCommerce functionality such as:&lt;/p&gt; &#13;
&#13;
				&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
				&lt;li&gt; Social commerce and customer reviews with &lt;strong&gt;Bazaarvoice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
				&lt;li&gt; Payment process and fraud avoidance management with  &lt;strong&gt;Cybersource&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;li&gt; Web 2.0 UI design, with &lt;strong&gt;Fluid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
				&lt;li&gt; Web analytics with &lt;strong&gt;Omniture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
				&lt;li&gt; Product configurations, with the complete integration of &lt;strong&gt;Timberland’s award-winning "boot configurator"&lt;/strong&gt; that enables Timberland consumers to design their own Timberland&amp;reg; boot&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
				&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;With the new site, Timberland’s eCommerce team now has complete control over all changes to site content, product images, page additions and deletions. "Demandware gives us direct control over switching out content without depending on internal IT staff or another third-party. This is what our international teams need to merchandise and market effectively," Brown noted.&lt;/p&gt; &#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;"Most eCommerce merchants cannot make even the simplest changes to their sites without the assistance of their IT department or eCommerce outsourcer," said Stephan Schambach, chairman and founder of Demandware.  "With Demandware, Timberland is not burdened with the traditional constraints of eCommerce platforms and is using that freedom to rapidly expand its international online business."&lt;/p&gt; &#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Brand, Product and Values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
				The new Timberland UK site offers footwear, apparel and accessories for men, women and children, allowing users to navigate through lifestyle-focused categories and click on "shoppable" images in promotional banners, much like a storefront window.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;More than just an online store, timberlandonline.co.uk has products and values interwoven throughout – aiming not only to increase sales for Timberland but also to raise awareness about the brand, the products and the company’s commitment to social responsibility and environmental stewardship.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;p&gt;The site also is an important resource for the company’s brick-and-mortar stores. Some visitors may "window shop" online and purchase at a store, or while shopping in a store customers could be referred to the Website to view a complete product selection.&lt;/p&gt; &#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, MA - January 23, 2008 &lt;/span&gt; - Demandware  &lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com" class="basic" title="Demandware developer of the breakthrough On-Demand eCommerce Platform"&gt;(www.demandware.com)&lt;/a&gt;, developer of the breakthrough On-Demand eCommerce Platform, announced today that UK-based House of Fraser has launched a new eCommerce site at www.houseoffraser.co.uk on the Demandware platform to expand the reach of its 300-plus online luxury designer brands. House of Fraser has ambitious goals for continued growth, fueled by the web.  The company aims to grow £100m through the eCommerce channel by 2009. Recently, during a multi-channel holiday promotion week, the House of Fraser site exceeded order expectations, handling end-user traffic ten-fold above the holiday season averages.&lt;/p&gt;  &#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solution Delivered Through New eCommera Platform&lt;/strong&gt;&#13;
The new House of Fraser site and eCommerce strategy was delivered in partnership with eCommera and Demandware.  eCommera helps European retailers build successful and sustainable online businesses by combining the advice and support of retail eCommerce experts with best-of-breed technology solutions, delivering a complete platform for cross-channel retail.  Demandware was selected by eCommera to power the Web store and online merchandising components of the eCommera platform, and House of Fraser is the first site launch for this new platform offering.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;"Demandware and eCommera are helping us to engage new customers and to meet our challenging revenue targets," said Peter Callaway, Director of eCommerce, House of Fraser. "We recognized that we needed to support our in-house merchants with the best functionality and tools to accomplish our growth objectives."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Demandware, eCommera has integrated and delivered to House of Fraser Web analytics, dynamic product visualization, payment processing and fraud management, order management and back-end integrations to House of Fraser’s existing systems.&lt;/p&gt; &#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best-in-Class Merchandising&lt;/strong&gt;&#13;
eCommera and House of Fraser chose Demandware for its best-in-class tools that enable merchants to have complete control of merchandising and marketing, freeing the IT department to focus on other initiatives. Demandware also offers a fully scalable and flexible platform and Software as a Service (SaaS) architecture, as well as seamless integration with its core systems and third-party partners.&lt;/p&gt; &#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Demandware platform allowed House of Fraser to achieve a rich visual experience, and implement a number of advanced Web 2.0 features. In constructing the new site, House of Fraser took advantage of Demandware’s faceted search features and ability to modify site navigation in order to focus on a truly brand-centric experience.&lt;/p&gt; &#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;"House of Fraser is a brand-conscious department store serving brand-conscious customers," said Colette Wilson, eCommerce Development lead for House of Fraser. "Demandware gives us the ability to completely control the brand experience and achieve the same high touch shopping experience enjoyed by shoppers in our brick-and-mortar stores."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Merchandising and Marketing to Brand-Conscious Customers&lt;/strong&gt;&#13;
House of Fraser took advantage of Demandware’s best-of-breed merchandising and marketing tools to create a user-friendly shopping experience that appeals to House of Fraser brand-conscious shoppers. Some of the key site features include:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shop by brand&lt;/strong&gt;. House of Fraser’s Brand Directory page provides an alphabetical link to more than 300 brands, giving consumers what they want: easy access to all products from their favorite brand names. The resulting brand landing pages give the impression of a site within the site.&lt;/li&gt;  &#13;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previously viewed products&lt;/strong&gt;. Each top-level category page shows the shoppers their previously viewed products, creating a feeling of personalization and helping to motivate sales. Category pages also provide advanced imagery that allows shoppers to zoom in to close-up views of products.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checkout control&lt;/strong&gt;. To make the checkout experience as simple as possible and give the control to the consumer, House of Fraser is providing full split-shipment and gifting-at-checkout. The checkout area provides a clearly defined process indicator, letting consumers know exactly how many stages are left to complete checkout. Also in the checkout area, House of Fraser offers information on the benefits of becoming a registered user for new visitors.&lt;/li&gt; &#13;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
				&#13;
&lt;p&gt;"Luxury department stores like House of Fraser have a tremendous opportunity to distinguish themselves with an online experience as unique as their brands themselves," said Stephan Schambach, chairman and founder, Demandware. "With Demandware’s advanced eCommerce platform and best-of-breed merchandising and search functionality, House of Fraser merchants have the tools to help customers complete the brand experience with conversions."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, MA - January 23, 2008 &lt;/span&gt; - Demandware  &lt;a class="basic" title="Demandware developer of the breakthrough On-Demand eCommerce Platform" href="http://www.demandware.com"&gt;(www.demandware.com)&lt;/a&gt;, developer of the leading On-Demand eCommerce platform, today announced that it is launching the industry&amp;rsquo;s most complete set of online merchandising tools and services to create powerful and intuitive eCommerce selling capabilities for significantly increasing qualified traffic, average order size and conversion rates. &lt;a title=" Demandware&amp;rsquo;s Active Merchandising" href="http://www.demandware.com/Active%20Merchandising/merchandising,default,pg.html"&gt;Demandware&amp;rsquo;s Active Merchandising&lt;/a&gt;&amp;trade; functionality will run on a single task-based user interface. The entire suite of functionality will be available for customers as part of the Demandware offering and will roll out throughout 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Before having access to Active Merchandising&amp;trade;, online retailers were restricted to merchandising tools that were overly complex to use and manage or only offered basic functionality for maximizing sales. After thorough industry research and work with customers, prospects, and partners, Demandware has identified the need for a more comprehensive set of tools designed to focus on ecommerce merchandising tasks. Active Merchandising&amp;trade; puts the tools in the hands of the people that know best how to sell products and alleviates the need for IT staff involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Retailers tell us that their biggest pain points are centered on merchandising,&amp;quot; said Stephan Schambach, founder and chairman of Demandware.  &amp;quot;With Demandware&amp;rsquo;s Active Merchandising&amp;trade;, merchants finally have complete set of tools for controlling all merchandising functions that enable a significant uplift in sales across channels.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fully integrated merchandising-driven ecommerce platform drives uplift in sales&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The Active Merchandising&amp;trade; set of software tools is comprised of five modules all centered on a common task-based UI for complete control and usability.

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, MA - February 11, 2008 &lt;/span&gt; - Demandware  &lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com" class="basic" title="Demandware developer of the breakthrough On-Demand eCommerce Platform"&gt;(www.demandware.com)&lt;/a&gt;, developer of the breakthrough On-Demand eCommerce Platform, today announced that PFSweb, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFSW), a leading business process outsourcing firm specializing in multi-channel commerce and high-touch customer experience delivery, will embed the Demandware eCommerce Platform within its new, next-generation end-to-end ecommerce solution. Under this agreement, PFSweb will integrate and deliver the Demandware eCommerce Platform along with its services for order management, fulfillment, customer service, and emarketing, to offer a single unified solution for outsourced end-to-end ecommerce operations. Complete details on the PFSweb solution can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.pfsweb.com" class="basic" title="PFSweb, Inc." target="_blank"&gt;www.pfsweb.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;PFSweb customers can now begin to migrate to this new end-to-end solution. Roots, Canada's leading athletic lifestyle brand, has worked with PFSweb through the launch of both its U.S. and Canadian online retail businesses. Roots.com, an Internet Retailer Top 500 site, is expected to migrate to Demandware within the second quarter of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;"By selecting the combined PFSweb and Demandware solution, we feel we have positioned Roots.com to serve our current and future customers with the best possible online experience. This end-to-end solution will allow us to offer an innovative, tightly integrated multi-channel experience that encourages cross shopping and is completely representative of the Roots experience," said James Connell, Director of E-Commerce, Digital Marketing and New Media for Roots. "By engaging the combined efforts of PFSweb and Demandware, we will be able to focus on our core competency of operating our store, while benefiting from expertise of both organizations for IT and logistics."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;After a thorough evaluation of ecommerce alternatives, including commercially available licensed applications and home-grown solutions, PFSweb chose to partner with Demandware for the clear operational advantages of its on-demand delivery model and its industry-leading ecommerce merchandising capabilities.&lt;/p&gt; &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;"Demandware provides us with a true competitive advantage," said Mike Willoughby, President of PFSweb's Services Division. "Outsourcing should not force merchants to surrender brand and site control. By integrating Demandware's industry-leading ecommerce platform with PFSweb's market-leading fulfillment and customer care solutions, we are delivering a very unique end-to-end ecommerce outsourced solution that combines in-house site control with outsourced execution, comprised of best-of-breed components."&lt;/p&gt; &#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;"The opportunity for a comprehensive technology and BPO product is significant," said Rob Garf, Vice President and General Manager, Retail Strategies, in the February 2008 AMR Research Article, "PFSweb + Demandware." "Some 69% of retailers will replace their current e-commerce platform (for order capture, catalog and content management, pricing and promotion management, and order inquiry) by the end of 2008, a recent AMR Research study shows."&lt;/p&gt; &#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;PFSweb selected Demandware based on a number of differentiating capabilities, including:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In-house merchandising control, outsourced business processes:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognizing market frustration with the limited merchandising and site control provided by legacy outsourcing vendors, PFSweb required a solution that enables its clients to retain full control over site merchandising and the consumer experience. With Demandware, PFSweb clients have the option to fully control promotions, catalog, pricing and customer site experiences, while benefiting from PFSweb's robust support for fulfillment and customer care.&lt;/li&gt;  &#13;
&#13;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on ecommerce, not infrastructure:&lt;/strong&gt; By embedding Demandware's on-demand ecommerce platform, PFSweb and its clients are relieved of the technical burdens and risk of managing the hardware, database, network and on-going maintenance required to run a best-in-class ecommerce application. This burden has led directly to the pitfalls of legacy outsourcing solutions, such as inflexible technologies and business processes, high service costs, and difficulty keeping sites current with the latest ecommerce innovations.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast launch of new global businesses:&lt;/strong&gt; A global provider, PFSweb serves customers that are expanding into international markets. PFSweb clients can leverage Demandware's multi-site, multi-brand and multi-currency capabilities to launch and drive new global brands quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simplified access to ecommerce innovation:&lt;/strong&gt; Because ecommerce is constantly evolving, outsourced providers must keep their clients at the forefront of innovation. By selecting Demandware, PFSweb clients can receive free automatic upgrades quarterly, enabling them to continually implement ecommerce best practices.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration across customer touch points:&lt;/strong&gt; As a provider of outsourced contact centers and a leader in high-touch customer care, PFSweb required that its ecommerce platform enable a seamless customer experience between the site and contact center. With Demandware, PFSweb can fully integrate pricing, promotions, product content and session behavior to the contact center, for better customer service and higher conversion.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&#13;
				&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
				&#13;
&lt;p&gt;"Time after time, customers are asking for a new end-to-end ecommerce solution, one that provides them with the freedom and flexibility to control their brands and customer site experiences, while enjoying the benefits of end-to-end process outsourcing," said Stephan Schambach, Chairman and Founder, Demandware. "With PFSweb, the market now has a best-in-class solution—full control over the ecommerce storefront, with the backing of a leading end-to-end provider."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PFSweb:&lt;/strong&gt; leading business process outsourcing firm selected Demandware in early 2008 to power its new end-to-end ecommerce solution.&#13;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Continuous Product Innovation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
Demandware introduced 92 new product features to its eCommerce Platform in 2007, including updates to its promotions, catalog, pricing and site search functionality. All enhancements were delivered automatically to customers’ ecommerce environments through hands-free upgrades. Significant product advancements include:&#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advanced searchandising:&lt;/b&gt; ecommerce site search, tightly coupled with the product catalog, gives merchants real-time control over search relevancy rankings from within a single UI.&#13;
&#13;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source codes:&lt;/b&gt; source codes enable merchants to tie specific marketing actions to explicit merchandising tactics, thereby increasing customer conversion rates.  &#13;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gift registry: &lt;/b&gt;merchants can coordinate the registry of gifts online with physical stores and across multiple product categories, with inventory decrements appearing in real-time to ensure product availability.&#13;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customer groups: &lt;/b&gt;dynamic and explicit customer segmentation based on specific attributes or shopping behaviors can be leveraged for more targeted merchandising and marketing. &#13;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Social merchandising: &lt;/b&gt;product-level integration with Bazaarvoice and PowerReviews, allows the display of ratings and reviews for a better shopping experience. &#13;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enterprise-Class eCommerce Platform, Delivered On-Demand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
Demandware is the only enterprise-class ecommerce platform that combines unsurpassed performance, security, integration and customization capabilities with the benefits of an on-demand delivery model, including hands-free upgrades and world-class data centers. Demandware reached the following service delivery milestones in 2007 and early 2008:&#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;More than 10,000 customer days operating live ecommerce sites: &lt;/b&gt;the equivalent of 26 years of proven operational experience. &#13;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;99.97% average uptime: &lt;/b&gt;site availability and uptime performance exceeding the average of the Gomez Top 50 Internet Retailer Site Performance Index.&#13;
&#13;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;PCI 1.1 DSS compliance certification: &lt;/b&gt;the first on-demand ecommerce platform to achieve the highest level of PCI compliance. &#13;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two-way SSL: &lt;/b&gt;for secure inter-application communication.&#13;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Committed to Client Success&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
In September 2007, Demandware held its first annual Client Advisory Board (CAB), a forum for senior client executives to help shape the direction of Demandware’s business strategy and product roadmap. The CAB is part of a comprehensive Client Success Program, a collaborative effort between Demandware and its customers for enhancing their ecommerce initiatives, delivering leading-edge technical capabilities, and maximizing their online revenue growth.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;lucy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;reg; brand&amp;rsquo;s Web site, launched in 1999, has been a key channel for delivering  solutions to consumers searching for lifestyle apparel that fits, flatters and  inspires.  Since re-launching in 2004, the &lt;em&gt;lucy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;reg; brand&amp;rsquo;s online business has more  than doubled&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;To support its  continued online growth, &lt;em&gt;lucy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;reg; &lt;em&gt;activewear&lt;/em&gt; is partnering with Demandware, which will  deliver its platform with innovative merchandising capabilities and manage the  hardware and maintenance for the site. The &lt;em&gt;lucy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;reg; brand expects to launch its enhanced site near the end of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our ecommerce site is a key sales channel  for the &lt;em&gt;lucy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;reg; brand, as approximately  50 percent of our in-store customers  also visit us online. In fact, many of our customers come into the store with  printouts of outfits that are showcased on the site,&amp;rdquo; said Rebecca Taubman, director  of ecommerce for &lt;em&gt;lucy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;reg;. &amp;ldquo;As traffic to our Web site continues to increase, our  enhanced Web site and platform will enable us to offer customers a  sophisticated, stress-free shopping experience, as well as targeted  cross-channel promotions and guaranteed availability.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&lt;p align="left"&gt;&amp;ldquo;The &lt;em&gt;lucy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;reg; brand is an incredible success story and we are proud to have the  opportunity to offer them our services,&amp;rdquo; said Demandware&amp;rsquo;s Chairman and Founder  Stephan Schambach.  &amp;ldquo;Demandware is  ideally suited for high-growth brands like &lt;em&gt;lucy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;reg;   because we have built our company around the needs of fast-growing merchants  who require the freedom and flexibility to focus on the business of driving  sales and building relationships.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

Launched in 2000, the &lt;em&gt;lucy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;reg; brand was created to  inspire a woman&amp;rsquo;s active life; since then, &lt;em&gt;lucy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;reg; &lt;em&gt;activewear&lt;/em&gt; has grown from its  origins as lucy.com, an online retailer, to a vertical retailer currently  operating 63 stores nationwide. Today, the &lt;em&gt;lucy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;reg; brand  continues to provide versatile, fashionable performance apparel for active  women. In August 2007, VF Corporation, a global leader in lifestyle  branded apparel, completed its acquisition of &lt;em&gt;lucy&lt;/em&gt;&amp;reg; &lt;em&gt;activewear, Inc&lt;/em&gt;.

        <custom-attributes>
            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;Woburn, MA – July 8,  2008  – &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Demandware&lt;/a&gt;, developer of the only enterprise-class &lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com/Platform/platform,default,pg.html" target="_blank"&gt;on-demand ecommerce  platform&lt;/a&gt;,  today announced that &lt;a href="http://www.richlundventures.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Richlund  Ventures&lt;/a&gt; has selected the Demandware eCommerce Platform to power all of its  home living destination ecommerce sites. The multi-brand retail equity firm  recently launched two Web storefronts on Demandware&amp;mdash;&lt;a href="http://www.compactappliance.com/" target="_blank"&gt;www.compactappliance.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.livingdirect.com/" target="_blank"&gt;www.livingdirect.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;mdash;with plans to  roll out additional sites in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Compact  Appliance provides small-format home appliances, while Living Direct provides a  broader spectrum of home living products, including appliances, outdoor furniture  and housewares. The combined annual revenue of the two brands is approximately  $37 million. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Founded  in 1999, Richlund Ventures is a privately-owned  company that specializes in identifying niche and emerging markets and meeting  the needs and challenges those opportunities present through multiple retail  websites. The  company's direct retail brands include Compact Appliance, Living Direct,  EdgeStar, Portable Airshop, Hot Water Source and Richlund Supply. Richlund Ventures  wanted an &lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com/" target="_blank"&gt;ecommerce solution&lt;/a&gt; that was  easily customizable, included &lt;a href="http://demandware.com/Active%20Merchandising/active_merchandising,default,pg.html" target="_blank"&gt;rich  merchandising capabilities&lt;/a&gt;, allowed them to launch multiple sites quickly  and didn't require a significant investment in IT infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;"Everything  is better with Demandware," said Jason Roussos, president of Richlund Ventures.  "It has been a fundamental change in how we do business. We are projecting  significant growth for our online channel and with Demandware we have an &lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com/Platform/platform,default,pg.html" target="_blank"&gt;ecommerce  platform&lt;/a&gt; that can take us to the next level."&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Richlund  Ventures selected Demandware because of the following differentiators:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full in-house control:&lt;/strong&gt;  Richlund  Ventures needed to be able to easily customize their sites and make changes  quickly.  Demandware provides full  control over merchandising promotions, search, catalog, pricing and all other  aspects of the online shopping experience.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous innovation through the on-demand model&lt;/strong&gt;: Demandware's automatic  upgrades allows Richlund Ventures to constantly innovate their sites, while  eliminating the burden of maintaining costly IT infrastructure.  &lt;/li&gt;&#13;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ability to launch multiple sites quickly, without costly  services&lt;/strong&gt;: Demandware's  architecture makes it possible to quickly roll out multiple sites from within  one environment. The second site, compactappliance.com, was launched with no  assistance from Demandware and in less than 45 days. &lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;"We  are a retailer, not a technology company. We don't want to own the technology  or the infrastructure, but we are fast-moving and it's important that we stay  ahead of the innovation curve," said Roussos. "With Demandware, we can take  advantage of the constant stream of new features that they provide, while we focus  on our core competency of marketing and merchandising our product offerings."&lt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;"Richlund Ventures is an incredibly astute retail equity firm that understands  the potential of the online channel and we're delighted to welcome them to the  Demandware family. Along with Demandware's other multi-site clients, Richlund  Ventures recognizes the unique operational advantages of our on-demand model  for serving multi-brand businesses," said Stephan Schambach, chairman and  founder of Demandware. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About  Richlund Ventures&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
  Founded  in 1999 with the launch of the Compact Appliance.com website, Richlund Ventures  is a privately owned company that specializes in identifying niche and emerging  markets and meeting the needs and challenges those opportunities present  through multiple retail websites. Richlund Ventures' flagship website  continues to be Compact Appliance.com which was created to provide an online  destination for people in search of distinctive home appliances that offer  superior style and maximum functionality. In addition to its online  marketing and retail division, Richlund Ventures is the direct importer for the  EdgeStar line of appliances.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Richlund  Ventures' sustained level of success is attributable to a consistent focus on  innovation, evolving marketing techniques and a continual emphasis on offering  the best service and sales support possible. Since inception, the company  has always understood that in order to maintain viability in today's  marketplace, it must provide first-class service and sales support and measures  success by how well it is able to execute that directive. Richlund  Ventures is uniquely positioned through the Compact Appliance.com website to  take advantage of emerging growth trends such as retiring baby boomers  downsizing their living spaces and the worldwide move towards more environmentally  conscious "green" appliances.&amp;nbsp; The company is located in Austin, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;PLANO, TX &amp;ndash; August 12, 2008 &amp;ndash; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.demandware.com/"&gt;PFSweb, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; (Nasdaq: PFSW),&lt;/strong&gt; a global provider of end-to-end web commerce solutions for leading online retailers and manufacturers, today announced the launch of an end-to-end solution for Roots.com that features the Demandware eCommerce Platform and integration with select interactive marketing partners, including Sitebrand and Coremetrics.  The Canadian and U.S. online storefronts also feature user experience design by Fluid&amp;rsquo;s award winning interactive agency team, and will soon offer hosted social commerce capabilities from Bazaarvoice, including product ratings and reviews. In addition, the robust solution includes inventory capabilities, including carbon neutral shipping options, which supply Roots&amp;rsquo; international customers, in over 30 countries, from multiple North American distribution centers.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;James Connell, Senior Director of E-Commerce, Digital Marketing &amp;amp; New Media for Roots, commented, &amp;ldquo;We are excited to launch a new and improved eCommerce channel that better serves the needs of our customers and positions our brand for accelerated online growth.  PFSweb&amp;rsquo;s end-to-end solution is bolstered by the dynamic capabilities across leading technology and marketing partners.  This new solution offers us multiple upgrades from our previous site, powerful marketing and merchandising capabilities, and tremendous flexibility and control over our brand.  Most critical to Roots, it also allows us to better serve our online customers&amp;rsquo; needs and improve their overall shopping experience.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The launch of the new Roots.com represents a significant milestone for our company,&amp;rdquo; said Mike Willoughby, President of PFSweb Services Division.  &amp;ldquo;We carefully architected our end-to-end eCommerce solution to address the specific needs of our clients and their customers, and we&amp;rsquo;re excited to see such synergy and close collaboration between the various partners, all market leaders, that comprise and bolster this solution.  We felt that compromise was not an option, so we worked closely with Roots to define exactly what the ideal solution would entail&amp;hellip;and then we crafted it.  Roots has been an important client of ours for the past nine years.  We&amp;rsquo;ve seen them maintain an unwavering commitment to their customers and translate that into all aspects of how they operate their business.  Now that we have an optimized, scalable solution in place, we are all focused on generating demand and facilitating profitable growth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;As previously announced, Roots.com has migrated to the Demandware platform to leverage the full benefits of PFSweb&amp;rsquo;s end-to-end offering.  With Demandware as the core eCommerce platform for the Roots online storefronts, the brand is able to utilize increased eCommerce functionality and retain full control over merchandising promotions, search, catalog, pricing and all other aspects of the online shopping experience.  With Demandware, Roots can easily customize their sites to reflect the unique Roots brand experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The newly launched initiative also empowers Roots&amp;rsquo; eCommerce channel with enhanced interactive marketing capabilities.  &amp;ldquo;Company-wide, we are very focused on growing our online channel and building multi-channel relationships with our customers,&amp;rdquo; added James Connell.  &amp;ldquo;With the right partners in place, my team is better able to extend the Roots brand in the online format and merchandise while tailoring our dialogue to each customer and their unique desires and needs.  For example, Sitebrand provides Roots with the tools to present relevant, personalized web content to unique site visitors or segments, based on individual visitor attributes and behaviors, such as first time visitors, referring URLs, search engine keywords, connection speed, geo-location, click-paths, time spent on site and buying history.  This results in increased shopper conversion rates, increased revenues and increased customer satisfaction.  With Coremetrics, we have greater visibility into customer behavior and key performance metrics, and through integration with our other marketing partners, can optimize personalization efforts.

            <page-title xml:lang="x-default">eCommerce News &amp; Events On-Demand | Demandware Shares 10 Tips for Getting Your eCommerce Site Holiday-Ready</page-title>
        </page-attributes>
        <custom-attributes>
            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;WOBURN, Mass. – August 18, 2008 – &lt;/span&gt;As more consumers choose to shop online this holiday season, &lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Demandware&lt;/a&gt;, developer of the only enterprise-class &lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com/Platform/platform,default,pg.html" target="_blank"&gt;on-demand ecommerce  platform&lt;/a&gt;, offers online retailers 10 tips for getting their sites ready for the holidays.  With less than five months to prepare, Jamus Driscoll, VP of Marketing at Demandware urges ecommerce merchandisers and managers to consider the following:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p style="margin-left:20px; text-indent:-20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. &amp;nbsp; Make sure your customers can find you.&lt;/b&gt;  Eighty percent of shopping trips start with the search box, and that percentage increases during the holidays.  Look through your search logs from last November forward to identify ways to improve site search effectiveness.  Typical fixes include: &#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Adding to synonym/hypernym dictionaries &#13;
&lt;li&gt;Enhancing product descriptions (adding relevant keywords) &#13;
&lt;li&gt;Expanding product assortment (consider adding product lines that customers seem to want but you don’t yet carry in time for the holidays) &#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p style="margin-left:20px; text-indent:-20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. &amp;nbsp; Build out your affiliate network.&lt;/b&gt;  Under current economic conditions, shoppers are going to be very savvy when looking for the best deal online.  Now is the time to start building strong relationships with those affiliates that are likely to drive significant traffic and volume to your site during the holidays.  Consider setting up automated product feeds to key shopping comparison sites like GoogleBase, Shopzilla, NexTag and other sites that your customers frequent.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p style="margin-left:20px; text-indent:-20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. &amp;nbsp; Set your product catalog.&lt;/b&gt; Pay particular attention to catalog readiness for cross-selling and up-selling opportunities, product related promotions and product categorization for easy navigation.  Make sure products are easy to find by adding proper keywords for search results.  Also, make sure you have the capability to cross-merchandise products in different categories – during the holidays, you’ll want to present a given product in both its “home” category (e.g. men’s shirts) and also theme, event or occasion-based categories like “Gifts for Dad,” “Pre-Thanksgiving Sale,” “Hot Gift Ideas,” etc.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p style="margin-left:20px; text-indent:-20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. &amp;nbsp; Prepare holiday site enhancements.&lt;/b&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Add “wish list” functionality.  By helping customers create the list and linking other people to that list, you not only convert a “wish” to a completed sale, you reduce returns and increase customer satisfaction.  &#13;
&lt;li&gt;Promote gift certificates and gift cards. Promote gift certificates on the homepage and other frequently visited landing pages, and add the ability to redeem them to the checkout process.  Gift certificate purchases have grown by leaps and bounds over the past 10 years.  &#13;
&lt;li&gt;Offer gift wrapping. This service adds convenience and creates differentiation from other retailers.  It also helps your customers save time during the busy holiday season, which will ultimately build customer loyalty.&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p style="margin-left:20px; text-indent:-20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. &amp;nbsp; Segment your audience.&lt;/b&gt; The holidays are the season for gifts—most shoppers are buying for other people.  For example if you’re a jeweler, anticipate that men will be buying for women.  Change the look and feel, products and promotions for the type of audience that is going to be buying during the holidays. &#13;
&#13;
&lt;p style="margin-left:20px; text-indent:-20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. &amp;nbsp; Bestsellers and gift ideas.&lt;/b&gt; Highlight these items on your homepage to provide additional gift ideas for uncertain shoppers. Create detailed gift guides based on the recipient, the price point and other elements to lead customers to a purchase.&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p style="margin-left:20px; text-indent:-20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. &amp;nbsp; Engage in A/B testing now.&lt;/b&gt; Engage in A/B testing of new site design concepts, features and functionality to get some real-world data before settling on what you’ll ultimately go with during the holidays.  For some merchants, the back-to-school season might be an ideal time for this type of testing. &#13;
&#13;
&lt;p style="margin-left:20px; text-indent:-20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. &amp;nbsp; Get creative with promotions.&lt;/b&gt; Don’t just use flat discounts to drive traffic - think about the long-term relationship with the customer.  Think about loyalty-based promotions that will create repeat customers and word-of-mouth marketing.  Also create a sense of urgency by making order-by dates and time-sensitive offers part of your promotions strategy.  &#13;
&#13;
&lt;p style="margin-left:20px; text-indent:-20px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. &amp;nbsp; Leverage social merchandising.&lt;/b&gt; Beyond adding a comments and review section on product pages, consider these other social merchandising tactics:  &#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Allowing customers to create desired “outfits” or bundles of multiple products, and saving/sending these to friends and family &#13;
&lt;li&gt;Enabling/encouraging customers to post favored products to their Facebook or MySpace profiles, or to vertical networking sites like StyleFeeder&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Making use of instant messaging, mobile marketing/advertising and RSS as channels for holiday marketing and promotional campaigns&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;p style="margin-left:27px; text-indent:-27px"&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. &amp;nbsp; Update inventory on product pages. &lt;/b&gt; Nothing infuriates a customer more than to find out that the product is out of stock after the completion of the checkout process.  Post inventory levels on every product page to set expectations for customers and also create a sense of urgency when levels are low.  Make this a year-round practice!&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;LAS VEGAS (&lt;a href="http://www.shop.org/summit08"&gt;Shop.org Annual Summit&lt;/a&gt;) - September 15, 2008 &lt;/span&gt; - Demandware  &lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com" class="basic" title="Demandware On-Demand eCommerce Solution"&gt;(www.demandware.com)&lt;/a&gt;, today announced that Jones Apparel Group (NYSE:  JNY) (“Jones”) has launched two online storefronts on Demandware, Easy Spirit and Nine West.  These e-commerce sites are the first to go live on Demandware, with additional sites, including Jones New York, Anne Klein and Bandolino planned for later this year and in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Jones Apparel Group is a leading designer, marketer and wholesaler of branded apparel, footwear and accessories, including handbags and jewelry. The Company selected the &lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com/"&gt;Demandware eCommerce Platform&lt;/a&gt; as the foundation for its direct-to-consumer online channel as part of an aggressive e-commerce growth strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;“We have been very pleased with our decision to go with the Demandware eCommerce Platform,” said Ron Offir, President of E-Commerce for Jones Apparel Group. “As a fashion brand, we believe our competitive advantage is in merchandising and marketing our products. With Demandware, we have industry-leading merchandising capabilities and complete control over our sites, without having to worry about servers and maintaining a costly and burdensome technology infrastructure.” &lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The new sites include custom features such as “Look Book,” which guides consumers through the purchase of a complete outfit;  “Scene &amp; Seen,” which helps consumers shop for items seen in magazines, TV, etc.; and “Time-Based Assets,” which provides the ability for merchandisers and marketers to pre-schedule site asset changes. &lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Jones Apparel Group wanted an e-commerce platform that would enable it to quickly and cost-effectively launch multiple brand online storefronts, without having to incur massive infrastructure costs. With Demandware, Jones was able to develop a re-useable set of core functionality enabling the quick roll-out of multiple distinct e-commerce sites.  In less than six months, Jones was able to launch the first two brands, Easy Spirit and Nine West, as well as get other sites, including Jones New York and Bandolino, well underway.  Jones will now leverage the functionality and development environment that is already in place to quickly launch additional brands on an as-needed basis.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The Demandware eCommerce Platform provides Jones Apparel Group with the following key capabilities:&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Full in-house control:&lt;/b&gt;  Jones Apparel Group is able to customize the sites based on the needs of the individual brand and customer segment, with full control over merchandising promotions, catalog, pricing and all other aspects of the online shopping experience&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ability to launch multiple sites quickly:&lt;/b&gt; Demandware’s architecture makes it possible to develop multiple sites from a shared development environment, giving merchandisers the ability to work across multiple brands and sites from within one application &lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reduced infrastructure costs and maintenance:&lt;/b&gt; Demandware’s on-demand delivery model eliminates the need to invest and maintain costly IT infrastructure, freeing up valuable resources to focus on e-commerce merchandising &lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seamless upgrades:&lt;/b&gt; Automatic upgrades allow Jones Apparel Group to continually leverage new merchandising functionality for site innovation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;“Jones Apparel Group has built itself into the pinnacle of the fashion industry through product and merchandising excellence. With Demandware, it can now extend those capabilities to the online channel to grow its brands worldwide, all without the technology bloat of traditional e-commerce applications,” said Stephan Schambach, chairman and founder, Demandware.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&#13;
&lt;p&gt;This webinar will feature a presentation from Forrester Research analyst Brian Walker, and will include a detailed case study of a leading retailer that realized an ROI of 153% from its replatforming investment.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers looking to launch a new site for the 2009 holiday season need to start planning their replatforming project today. Unfortunately, the decision to replatform can be difficult for many organizations, whose management teams are often cautious of the required investment and uncertain of the results and benefits. By building a solid business case based on quantifiable metrics and realistic goals, eBusiness leaders can educate key decision makers, manage expectations and harness internal champions to successfully win buy-in for this strategic investment.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Webinar attendees will be guided through:&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Fundamental best practices for a successful ecommerce pitch&#13;
&lt;li&gt;The definition of customer-centric, IT-centric and operations-centric value&#13;
&lt;li&gt;The development of a simple, but effective ROI model, based on measurable KPIs with reliable history&#13;
&lt;li&gt;An examination of the potential hidden costs of a new platform&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Techniques for selling your project and gaining internal support&#13;

&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Now more than ever, acquiring and retaining customers is a top priority for ecommerce professionals. But without the proper information and analytics, marketing costs can run the risk of jeopardizing revenue. Ecommerce executives need to know exactly how much they are spending on acquiring a new customer or retaining an existing one. More importantly, they need to be certain they are spending the correct amount. Making good use of customer transactional data can help online retailers predict future behavior and hone their marketing strategies to create a targeted and effective customer acquisition and retention approach that maximizes ROI.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Webinar attendees will learn:&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;How to use your existing transactional data to develop a customer acquisition and retention strategy that balances your desire for growth with the need for fiscal responsibility&#13;
&lt;li&gt;The requirements and methodology for incorporating customer analytics into your regular business processes &#13;
&lt;li&gt;How to use customer analytics to navigate the future path of your direct-to-consumer business. &#13;

In his new role, Dussault is responsible for all the financial and administrative operations of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;"We’re extremely pleased to bring Scott on board during this exciting time for the company.  The financial model of on-demand software is becoming more attractive to retailers who need a reliable ecommerce platform, but don’t want to incur the hefty up-front costs typically associated with it.  As we continue to experience high demand, we knew it was the right time to bring on a financial expert to ensure our continued success," said Stephan Schambach, founder and chairman of Demandware.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining Demandware, Dussault was Chief Financial Officer at Archivas, Inc., a developer and distributor of an online storage management solution designed for long-term storage of fixed-content digital assets.  Archivas was acquired by Hitachi Data Systems in February 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to Archivas, Dussault was Chief Financial Officer for Astra Tech, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Astra Zeneca and a distributor of medical devices.  Before Astra Tech, he was Chief Financial Officer of StorageNetworks, a publicly-traded data-storage software and services company. While at the company, he was instrumental in growing it from a startup to revenues of $124 million in three years, plus building the infrastructure to support more than 700 employees in 16 different cities. Dussault began his career with Ernst &amp; Young LLP, where he earned his CPA and was a manager in the Entrepreneurial Services and Audit Services areas.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;"I am thrilled to be joining such a successful team as we continue to shape the business and financial strategy that will help Demandware achieve its strategic objectives," said Dussault.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Dussault holds a Bachelors of Science degree in Business Administration/Accounting from Stonehill College. He is a CPA and a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&lt;p&gt;These performance metrics are in stark contrast with industry averages, including a 3 percent decline in overall online spending for the 2008 holiday season when compared to the same period 2007 (source: &lt;a href="http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?press=2658" title="ComScore" target="_blank"&gt;ComScore&lt;/a&gt;) and 96.81 percent average site availability among the nation’s top 50 e-commerce sites, according to the US Internet Retailer Benchmark (source: &lt;a href="http://www.gomez.com/products/viewbenchmark.php?btype=8" title="Gomez" target="_blank"&gt;Gomez&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&#13;
&lt;p&gt;“Based on Demandware clients’ performance this holiday season, it appears that the European market experienced less demand volatility than in the U.S.  The ecommerce market there continues to show comparatively stronger growth as more consumers shift their shopping online and retailers upgrade their sites with state-of-the-art functionality,” said Julian Chu, Director of Client Success, Demandware. “But Demandware’s retailers in both regions were able to drive year-on-year growth in total sales and order volume, and in many cases average order value as well.  The latter was a particular challenge – heavy discounting during the season put pressure on average unit prices, but retailers’ effective use of promotions and cross-selling helped to push basket sizes up in the other direction.”&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

Together, the companies will offer retailers actionable advice on fine-tuning their ecommerce strategies for the current economic climate. During this live webinar, Danielle Savin, a leading industry consultant and former ecommerce executive at Playboy Enterprises and Frederick's of Hollywood, will review areas where retailers can fine-tune, adapt and optimize programs to overcome the challenges of a down economy.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;While cutting back on programs now may result in short-term cost savings, it also results in the longer term problem of increased customer attrition. Consumers don't stop spending during a recession, but they do make their purchasing decisions more carefully. Now is the time for retailers to increase their marketing prowess and capture market share. Rather than cutting programs, identify areas to fine-tune to obtain the same or better results for less money.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

By partnering with Demandware, Crocs will have a scalable ecommerce platform that provides complete brand control and enables the retailer to quickly expand its online business globally with sites in the U.S., Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Initially developed as a boating/outdoor shoe touted for its superior grip and non-marking sole, Crocs Footwear quickly became a bona-fide phenomenon, worn for comfort, function and fashion.  Today, the company is in the process of expanding its global online business. Crocs needed a way to rapidly establish an &lt;a href="http://blog.demandware.com/blog/bid/8059/Have-questions-about-International-Ecommerce-Expansion-Ask-them-here" title="International Expansion" target="_blank"&gt;international online presence&lt;/a&gt; while maintaining full control over its brand so it can focus on delivering a rich and dynamic shopping experience for customers.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;“Online growth is an important area of focus for us as we launch new sites in a number of international markets over the next two-three years.  We selected Demandware because we needed an ecommerce platform that could help us meet this ambitious timeline for international growth, while giving us complete freedom to control the look and feel of our sites without having to manage and maintain the infrastructure,” said Chris Ladd, Crocs' VP of Global eCommerce.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;“Demandware’s business model is very attractive in this current global economy, when large-scale capital infrastructure projects are increasingly difficult to justify. Its on-demand delivery and pricing model makes it cost-effective for companies like Crocs to continue to drive ecommerce projects forward, setting us up for long-term success,” said Ladd.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Demandware provides Crocs with the following key capabilities to support its multi-site, global ecommerce initiative:&#13;
&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Ability to develop  multiple sites quickly from a common architecture&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Extensive expertise launching ecommerce sites  internationally&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Full in-house control  over merchandising promotions, catalog, pricing and all other aspects of the  online shopping experience to easily customize sites per region or product line &lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Seamless, automatic  upgrades to continually leverage new merchandising  functionality for site innovation&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Support for multiple languages, currencies and  payment types &lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;Integration with various payment and backend  systems&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;On-demand model that eliminates  the need to invest and maintain costly geographically dispersed IT  infrastructure&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;“Crocs is an innovative brand that has quickly become a household name, and we are thrilled that the company has chosen Demandware as its ecommerce platform,” said Stephan Schambach, founder and chairman of Demandware. “With Demandware, Crocs is able to significantly cut the time to market for their international sites so they can begin tapping into new markets and driving revenue.”&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

            <custom-attribute attribute-id="body" xml:lang="x-default">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;WOBURN, Mass. &amp;ndash; January 26, 2009 &amp;ndash; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com" title="Demandware" alias="Demandware" target="_blank"&gt;Demandware&lt;/a&gt;, developer of the only &lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com/Platform%20Overview/platform_overview,default,pg.html" title="eCommerce Platform" alias="eCommerce Platform" target="_blank"&gt;enterprise-class on-demand ecommerce platform&lt;/a&gt;, today announced that &lt;a href="http://www.samswine.com/" title="Sam's Wine &amp; Spirits" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Wines &amp; Spirits&lt;/a&gt; has launched a new ecommerce website powered by the Demandware eCommerce Platform.  After identifying the Internet as its next high-growth channel, the Chicago-based wine and spirits retailer selected Demandware because of the platform’s flexibility, relatively low cost of entry, and ability to launch the new site&amp;mdash;and future micro-sites&amp;mdash;quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The new site was designed and built by &lt;a href="http://www.lyonscg.com/" title="Lyons Consulting Group" target=_blank"&gt;Lyons Consulting Group&lt;/a&gt;, a Demandware &lt;a href="http://www.demandware.com/Solution%20Partners/solution-partners,default,pg.html" title="Solution Partners" target="_blank"&gt;solution partner&lt;/a&gt;. Sam’s Wines &amp; Spirits’ previous ecommerce site ran on a customized platform with limited opportunity for growth. Wanting to provide customers with a new, rich and engaging online shopping experience, Sam’s Wines got up and running on the Demandware platform in a matter of a few months. The new site eases the strain on Sam’s internal staff, supports content and commerce together, and provides improved merchandising capabilities.  For example, it allows Sam’s Wines to provide thousands of different wines that shoppers can browse by type, variety, country of origin, price, review, and even flavor summary or best food pairing options.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;“After entering into partnership with Demandware and Lyons, we were able to get our new site up and running in a few short months the fall of ‘08, which was very important because a significant portion of our annual sales happen during the holiday season,” said Merritt DeWitt, director of marketing at Sam’s Wines &amp; Spirits.  “Since the launch, we’ve more than doubled the number of unique products sold on the site in a month-to-month comparison to the prior year. Demandware also has enhanced our suggestive search capabilities to keep shoppers on the site and therefore spending more. Looking to the future, our new site enables us to take advantage of growth opportunities and allows us to compete head-on with nationally known online retailers that are getting into the business.”&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing shoppers with access to wine, beer, spirits and gourmet products, the new SamsWine.com has become a destination site that places an emphasis on education and community.  New features include:&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;A video channel and an article library of original content about the world of wine, spirits and beers including recommendations about successfully pairing food and wine, growing the best grapes, and wine service, storage, and glassware.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Event listings featuring tastings at area restaurants, wine and food dinners, film screenings, outdoor concerts and more.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Reviews from professional wine critics and national publications such as Wine Advocate, Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiast, plus “Sam’s Score” by Sam’s own experts.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;li&gt;Gift registries for wine and food enthusiasts.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;“We knew Demandware was a great fit for Sam’s Wines because of the platform’s robust merchandising capabilities,” said Rich Lyons, president of Lyons Consulting Group. “They needed a site that their team could change on a day-to-day basis, similar to changing the merchandising strategy in Sam’s Wines &amp; Spirits stores. Demandware made it easy for their non-technical staff to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;“Sam’s Wines &amp; Spirits is growing fast and has embraced the potential of the online channel to provide exceptional products and service to its demanding customer base,” said Stephan Schambach, Demandware’s founder and chairman.  “As Sam’s Wines’ online sales grow, the Demandware platform will grow along with it, always providing the most innovative features and functionality that will help Sam’s Wines stay ahead of its competition.”&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&lt;p&gt;At Demandware, we respect the privacy of our customers and the visitors to our website. This statement describes the current information gathering, sharing and privacy practices for our website, www.demandware.com.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;h2&gt;Collection of Personal Information&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;We will ask you when we need information that identifies you individually or allows us to contact you directly (personal information).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;We may ask for personal information when you purchase a product, enter a contest, request a service, complete a survey, subscribe to a news, or engage in some other activity on our site. In connection with these activities, we may ask you for contact information such as your name, telephone number, and email address.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;When you visit our website, we collect standard information about your hardware and software such as your IP addresses, browser type, operating system, pages visited on our site, referring and exit pages, and the dates and times of the visits.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;This site visitation data is used to administer the site and provide general statistics regarding the use of demandware.com. Site visitation data is never linked to your personal information, and we do not use it to identify you individually without your permission.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;h2&gt;Use of Personal Information&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;We will keep any and all information collected from you at this site strictly confidential and we will not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties for their promotional use without your permission.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;We will use the personal information you give us to fulfill the services and provide the products you request from us. This may include sending information that you have requested, or contacting you about products and services that you have purchased. If you do not opt-out of communications from Demandware, we may send you marketing notices including promotions of our products and services. You can opt-out of communications from Demandware at any time (see &amp;quot;Control of Personal Information&amp;quot; below).&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;We sometimes contract with other companies to provide services such as packaging and mailing information, answering user questions, or processing credit card transactions. We will only provide these partners with the information they need to conduct their services, they will be prohibited from using the information we provide for any other purpose and we will require them to observe the intent of this Privacy Policy.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;We may disclose your personal information when we reasonably believe that it is required by a law or legal process and to protect and defend our rights and interests and the rights and interests of our affiliates, suppliers, or users. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. We may release certain personal information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply these terms and conditions or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, an acquisition by another company, or a sale of all or a portion of our assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Notifications of such a transition will be made using the mechanisms described in the &amp;quot;Changes to this Statement&amp;quot; section below.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;h2&gt;Control of Personal Information&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;You can confirm, change, or update personal information you have provided to us by contacting us directly at privacy@demandware.com with your request.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to opt-out of communications from the company, you can do so by emailing your request to privacy@demandware.com. If you change your mind, you can opt-in again, by emailing this same address. When you opt-out of promotional communications from us, you may still receive service messages (such as an order confirmation), legally mandated notices, and critical messages that relate to the ability to use services you have purchased from us.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;h2&gt;Security of the Information We Collect&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;We are committed to protecting the security of your personal information, and we use a range of technologies and procedures to protect your personal information. For example, we store personal information in a secure, limited access facility; sensitive information transmitted to us through our store (such as a credit card number) is encrypted for transmission using the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. The SSL encryption is designed to make the information unreadable by anyone but us.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;h2&gt;Protection of Children's Privacy&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;demandware.com is a general interest website, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;h2&gt;Privacy and Online Forums&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Information you post in online forums on the site is accessible to other people who can access the forums and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. Personal information stored in your forum profile will not be displayed in the forum.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;h2&gt;Privacy and Tell-a-Friend Forms&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;When you use a tell-a-friend form on the site, we ask for the friend's name and email address. We will use this information to automatically send the specified email message to the friend. We will not use this information to contact the friend in the future. We will retain the information you provide for tracking purposes. If someone notified through tell a friend wishes to have their   										information removed from our database they can contact us at privacy@demandware.com.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;h2&gt;Use of Cookies and Clear gif Technology&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;When you visit our site, a cookie may be saved on your computer (if your computer accepts cookies), and if you return to the site the cookie may be read. We use cookies to help us collect the site visitation data described above and in some cases to deliver specialized content. A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your   										hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of our website use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. We do not correlate this information with data about individual users, nor do we share this information or sell it to any third party.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;If you prefer not to receive cookies on our website, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use any area of our website.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;We may also use Web beacons, clear gif technology, or action tags as mechanisms to collect aggregate site visitation data by tracking how users navigate to and through our website. We may also use this technology to track the delivery of HTML email messages. This data is collected exclusively for use in our marketing and research.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;h2&gt;Enforcement of this Statement&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;If you have questions about the policies described in this statement, please email us directly at privacy@demandware.com.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;h2&gt;Links to Other Websites&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Our website may contain links to other websites. If you use these links, you will leave our website. When you access a non-demandware.com website, even one that may contain the Demandware logo, please be aware that we do not control the content and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of that site and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of each site you use. This Privacy Statement does not cover the information practices of those websites linked to our website. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;h2&gt;Changes to this Statement&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;We may from time to time update this privacy statement. When we make these updates, we will change the &amp;quot;last updated&amp;quot; date listed at the top of the statement. If we make a material change to this statement that affects our use of your personal information, we will update users by placing a more prominent notice on our home page.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&#13;
&lt;p&gt;At Demandware, we know that keeping your credit card information secure is important to you. That makes it very important to us. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 128bit encryption technology to protect your online information.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we make sure information is secure? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
We use the latest encryption technology (Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL) to secure your personal information. The information you provide when you place an order is encrypted (or coded) using a secure server for maximum security. This coding makes it extremely difficult for anyone to reach your information as it moves through our ordering system.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Certain browsers will not allow communication through secure servers. If this is the case, you won't be able to place an order online. If you have any problems placing an order online please print your shopping page and place your order by phone at 800 555 1212. Please note that calls to 800 555 1212 that are not made from a UK landline may be subject to a charge.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;To check the security of your computer, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window if you are using Netscape, or the lower right-hand corner of your browser window if you are using Internet Explorer. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock, then the encryption technology is active and the server is secure. You can also check by looking at the URL line of your browser; when you access a secure server, the initial characters of the site address will be &amp;quot;https.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if you link to another site? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Our website may provide links to other websites that are not under our control. Neither we nor the third party service providers who manage our website are responsible for these linked websites, their content or for the actions of the providers of such sites. We recommend that you review the privacy and security policies and terms of use for any websites you use.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I have to turn the security feature on when I want to shop? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The security features are automatic, and always on. You don't have to do anything but shop. Clicking &amp;quot;Checkout&amp;quot; on any page is all it takes to get started in our secure checkout process.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I know if I'm connected when I start ordering? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Once you've clicked the &amp;quot;Continue Checkout&amp;quot; button, your browser looks for a digital certificate to confirm that it's communicating with our web-site. Once a positive ID is made, your order will continue securely.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are all the pages on your web-site secure? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Most of the pages on our website provide information about Demandware and our products. We make this information available freely and there's no reason for these pages to be &amp;quot;secure.&amp;quot; The pages that we make secure are the ones on which you actually make the purchase, such as when managing your account, checking your order status, or within the &amp;quot;Checkout&amp;quot; area. For example, the entire checkout process, from introduction to final confirmation, is completely secure.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is my information secure when it's transmitted across the Internet? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
All of your information is encrypted before it's transmitted across the Internet, then decoded only after it arrives at our secure servers.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
We take the privacy rights of users of this Site very seriously and this Privacy Policy explains to You how certain information about You may be processed.&lt;/p&gt;</custom-attribute>

&lt;div class="tips"&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hint:&lt;/strong&gt; For the most accurate results, measure yourself in your undergarments.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;ul&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neck:&lt;/strong&gt; Measure around the base of your neck, inserting your forefinger between the tape and your neck to allow ease in fit.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chest:&lt;/strong&gt; Measure around the fullest part of your chest, keeping tape firmly under your armpits and around your shoulder blades.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waist:&lt;/strong&gt; Measure around your waist, slightly below your natural waist, where you normally wear your pants. Insert your forefinger between the tape and your body to allow ease in fit.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleeve Length:&lt;/strong&gt; Bend your arm slightly. Measure from center back neck, across your shoulder, down to your elbow, down to your wrist.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hip:&lt;/strong&gt; Measure around the fullest part of your hips, inserting your forefinger between the tape and your hip to allow ease in fit.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inseam:&lt;/strong&gt; Measure a similar pant that fits you well. Measure along the inseam, from the crotch seam to the bottom of the hem.&lt;/li&gt;&#13;
&lt;/ul&gt;&#13;
&lt;/div&gt;&#13;
&lt;div class="nofit"&gt;&#13;
&lt;h2&gt;Doesn't Fit?&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;If it doesn't fit, return it within 28 days, as long as it's unworn, unwashed and unaltered.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;a href="$url('Page-Show', 'cid', 'returns')$"&gt;See Returns Policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;h2&gt;Between Sizes?&lt;/h2&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;If your measurements are in between those listed in the size chart, pick the next larger size.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I convert a man's size to a woman's?&lt;/strong&gt; (and vice versa)&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Because every foot is different and its measurements are unique, we can't offer a recommendation for converting men's or women's footwear sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;a href="$url('Page-Show', 'cid' , 'mens-footwear')$"&gt;Men's Size Chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
