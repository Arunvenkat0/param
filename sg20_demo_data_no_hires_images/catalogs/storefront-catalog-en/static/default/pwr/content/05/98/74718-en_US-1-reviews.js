Then I came across these, and I thought it was super cute and that my daughter needed a break from Dora. These were an instant hit! I got them with 4 Jibbitz (Mickey, Minnie, Daisy and Donald), and my daughter walked around the house in them all day! She called them the &quot;Mickey Mouse shoes&quot;, and they looked totally cute on her! They started off a little big, but it wasnt a problem since her feet were getting big fast (if you have a toddler, go up one size!). My issue is that her feet get pretty dirty after wearing them out. The nice thing that I found is that when the shoes get dirty, I put them in my washing machine (no spin, and remove Jibbitz) with a little soap, they look brand new! It was worth every penny! My daughter loves them, and whenever we go out, those are the shoes she wants to wear! Great buy!",g:[{n:"Best Uses",k:"bestuses",v:["Walking"]}]}}];
