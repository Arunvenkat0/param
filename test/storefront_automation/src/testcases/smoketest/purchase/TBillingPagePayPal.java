/**
 * Test Case ID:() 
 Preconditions
 
 Note:
 
 SG is not integrated with PayPal so orders cannot actually be placed using this payment method. This just tests the form on the billing page.
 Expected Results
 
 Choosing the PayPal payment method hides the CC field or whatever other payment method field was displayed and shows PayPal information instead.
